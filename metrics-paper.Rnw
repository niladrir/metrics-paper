\begin{abstract}
Graphics play a crucial role in statistical analysis and data mining. This paper describes metrics developed to assist the use of lineups for making inferential statements. Lineups embed the plot of the data, also called the {\it data} or {\it true plot}, among a set of null plots, and engage a human observer to select the plot that is most different from the rest. If the data plot is selected it corresponds to the rejection of a null hypothesis. Metrics are calculated in association with lineups, to measure the quality of the lineup, and help to understand what people see in the data plots.  The null plots represent a finite sample from a null distribution, and the selected sample potentially affects the ease or difficulty of a lineup. Distance metrics are designed to describe how close the true data plot is to the null plots, and how close the null plots are to each other. The distribution of the distance metrics is studied to learn how well this matches to what people detect in the plots, the effect of null generating mechanism and plot choices for particular tasks.  The analysis was conducted on data that has already been collected from Amazon Turk studies conducted with lineups for studying an array of data analysis tasks.

\section{Introduction} 
Graphics are an important component of big data analysis, providing a mechanism for discovering unexpected patterns in data. Pioneering research by \citet{gelman:2004}, \citet{buja:2009} and \citet{majumder:2011} provide methods to quantify the significance of discoveries made from visualizations. %Although, there have been major advances in statistical graphics over the years, for example, systems like R \citep{R} provide high quality static graphics, and very recently some access to interactive graphics. But the problem remains that graphics are not widely considered to be a part of inferential statistics. 
\citet{buja:2009} introduced two protocols which bridge the gulf between traditional statistical inference and exploratory data analysis. These are the Rorschach and the lineup protocols. \hh{The Rorschach protocol consists of a set of $m$ (usually, $m=20$) plots rendered from data that is consistent with a given null model.} That way, the Rorschach protocol helps to understand the extent of randomness \hh{in the null model}. The lineup protocol places a statistical plot firmly in the framework of hypothesis tests: a plot of the data is considered to be the test statistic. Unlike the simpler numeric test statistics in classical inference, plots as  test statistics are complex entities. In a lineup, the data plot is placed randomly among a  set of  null plots generated from a null model.
Human observers are then asked to  examine the lineup and to identify the most different plot. If observers identify the data plot, this is quantifiable evidence against the null hypothesis. 

Figure~\ref{lineup-example} is an example of a lineup \hh{where a more focussed test is considered}. Suppose we have the following statistical model

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \dots + \epsilon_i$$

\noindent and we are interested in testing the following hypothesis:

$$H_o : \beta_k = 0 \qquad \qquad \hbox{vs} \qquad \qquad H_A: \beta_k \ne 0$$

\noindent where $X_k$ is a continuous covariate. Assume, the data plot is a scatterplot of $Y$ against $X_k$ with a regression line overlaid. We can generate null plots from rendering simulating data from $N(X\hat{\beta}, \hat{\sigma}^2)$ and plotting using the same scatterplot method as the true data, where parameter estimates ($\hat{\beta}, \hat{\sigma}^2$) are obtained by fitting the null model to the true data. 
The plot of the true data is randomly placed among a set of ($m$ - 1) null plots to produce a lineup of size $m$. Rather than to identify the most different plot, human subjects are asked to identify the plot with the steepest slope from the lineup of Figure~\ref{lineup-example}. If the human subjects can identify the plot of the true data, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between $Y$ and $X_k$.

lpu <- unique(lp[,c("id", "response", "ip_address", "response_no", "plot_location")])
@
\hh{For the example of this lineup \Sexpr{sum(lpu$response)} out of \Sexpr{nrow(lpu)} observers correctly identify plot~\#2 as the data plot, providing very strong evidence of a linear relationship.}

Can you identify the plot with the steepest slope? }

The lineup protocol was formally tested in a head-to-head comparison with the equivalent conventional test in \citet{majumder:2011}. The experiment utilized human subjects from Amazon's Mechanical Turk \citep{turk} and used simulation to control conditions. The results suggest that  visual inference is comparable to conventional tests in a controlled conventional setting. This provides support for its appropriateness for testing in real exploratory situations where no conventional test exists. Interestingly, the power of a visual test increases with the number of observers engaged to evaluate lineups, and the pattern in results suggests that the power will provide results consistent with practical significance \citep{kirk:1996}.

%But there may be one issue when using the lineup protocol. In traditional hypothesis testing, the true value of the test statistic is compared with all possible values of its null distribution. If the statistic is extreme on this scale, there is evidence to disbelieve the null hypothesis. With the lineup protocol, for a data plot to be considered to be extreme, a human judge must pick it as different from the other plots in the lineup.

%{\color{red}***  Point 1: Finite comparison vs infinite comparison, measuring how different data plot is from null plots}

In traditional hypothesis testing, the sampling distribution of a test statistic is functional and continuous. In the lineup protocol, although conceptually we may have an infinite collection of plots from the null distribution, in practice, we can only evaluate against a finite number of null plots. A human judge has a physical limit on the number of plots they can peruse. This poses one of the issues with using the lineup protocol.  Figure~\ref{compare} illustrates the difference. In traditional inference, the black curve represents the sampling distribution for the $t$-distribution under the null hypothesis, and the shaded red area shows the rejection region. In visual inference, let us consider that the black curve gives the sampling distribution although the sampling distribution is essentially a distribution of null plots. 
\hh{While the test statistic is not numeric, we can calculate the value of the statistic from the data underlying the true plot. These values are shown using the red bar (data plot) and the blue bars (null plots) in Figure~\ref{compare}.}
%\hh{XXX why although? I'm afraid I don't understand, where the next sentence is trying to go.} Although the test statistic is not numeric, the true data plot which is the test statistic is represented using red bar and the null plots that are drawn from the null distribution are the blue bars. % for the plots in the lineup shown in Figure~\ref{lineup}. 
Effectively,  in visual inference the red line is compared  to only these finite number of blue lines  to make a decision, unlike classical inference where we look at the rejection region (Figure~\ref{compare}) to make decisions. Even though the data plot might be extreme, it is possible by randomly selecting from the null distribution, to obtain a null plot that is more extreme, as Tukey suggested \citep{fernholz03}:

\begin{quotation}
``There [in Tukey's Data Analysis class] I discovered that [...]  a random sample is indeed a ``batch of values'' which ``fail to be utopian'' most of the time.''
\end{quotation}


%{\color{red}***Point 2: Use metrics to ensure that a range of comparisons is made available to observers}

This can be partially solved by having a large number of observers, who each evaluate lineups constructed with different null plots. Having some idea of the type of coverage of the sampling distribution that is provided by the lineups would be useful ahead of engaging observers and evaluating the lineups. Could we say that lineup X is expected to be ``difficult'' but lineup Y is expected to be ``easy'' then it may help in determining an appropriate number of observers? A difficult lineup is one where the data plot is similar to the null plots, while the data plot in an easy lineup  has some feature that makes it very different from the null plots. Being able to compute a plot distance metric would be very helpful ahead of running a lineup protocol.

%Researchers needs to provide a range of comparisons to observers to judge. An efficient design of experiment would be to provide a range of lineup plots with varying difficulty to the human subjects to look at. So far the difficulty of a lineup can be evaluated based on the performance of the subjects. The performance of the subjects can be analyzed after the experiment. But as a researcher, it would be interesting to have an idea about the difficulty of the lineups even before the experiment is conducted so the subjects see a set of lineups with varying difficulty. Distance metrics can be of great help in this case. 


%To avoid basing conclusions on artifacts introduced by a `bad' sample, we need to be aware of properties of this set of null plots. In this paper, we develop techniques that help to determine the quality of the lineup. A variety of distance metrics measuring the ``closeness'' of the true data plot and the null plots, and the null plots with themselves are examined. These are compared to human subject picks in several Amazon Turk studies.  Describing plots numerically, is something  of an oxymoron, it cannot be done. Nonetheless, the distance measures provide indications of the quality of a lineup. The purpose of this paper is to help determine if a lineup might provide inadequate coverage of the full null distribution, and these measures might help to gain more insight on how the human eyes work in reading statistical graphics. 

%{\color{red} ***  Point 3: Metrics might replace human observers, eventually, but as of now, human eye can still beat numbers for finding unexpected patterns. The lineup protocol gives us a chance to evaluate metrics to finding unexpected structures - check out the scagnostics literature}

This is a two way process: As metrics are devised to measure the quality of a lineup, the lineup protocol also provides an opportunity to measure the performance of a metric. The human eye can detect patterns in a plot that cannot be easily quantified numerically, which is why graphics provide an important tool for exploring data and finding the unexpected. Describing plots numerically, is something  of an oxymoron, it cannot be universally done. An example in past work are {\it scagnostics}, short for scatterplot cognostics \citep{tukey:1977}, which were further investigated in form of graph-based scagnostics \citep{wilkinson2005graph}. Both attempt to assess various aspects of scattered points like outliers, shape, trend, density and coherence.  If a scatterplot has just one of these structures the scagnostics are descriptive, however, they fail terribly if a plot contains more than one \hh{or an unforeseen feature instead}. The goal here is to find  distance measures that can provide an indication of the quality of a lineup, and then to use the results of observer evaluation to determine which metrics best match what people see.

%{\color{red} *** Point 4: Metrics can help us understand what it is that people pick up on to trigger a detection of the data. Currently lineups rely on people verbally reporting why they picked a plot. }

Following up on choices, observers are asked to describe their reasoning. These reasons are used to obtain more information about the rejection: was it some nonlinear dependency, an outlier, clustering or something else that triggered the detection of the data plot? Good distance metrics may also help to relate the descriptive words used to mathematically defined features. 

The article is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:null} discusses the null generating mechanisms. Section~\ref{sec:meas} defines the distance measures and discusses the choice of the measures. The distribution of the distance measures are studied in Section~\ref{sec:distri}. Section~\ref{sec:plot_type} describes the effect of the plot type and the question of interest on the distance measure while Section~\ref{sec:eval} talks about the distance evaluations. In Section~\ref{sec:nbin}, the methods to select the number of bins for the binned distance is described. Section~\ref{sec:results} presents a comparison of the distance measures to the performance of human subjects in several experiments conducted by Amazon's Mechanical Turk.


%Any statistical analysis must include some sreftatistical graphics. For exploratory data analysis, statistical graphics play an invaluable role in model checking and diagnostics. Even though we have established mathematical procedures to obtain various statistics, we need to support the results by also producing the relevant plots. 

%In recent times there have been major advances in statistical graphics. Modern computing systems like R and SAS produce high quality statistical graphics. Buja et al. 2009, following from Gelman 2004, proposed two protocols that allow the testing of discoveries made from statistical graphics.

%In this paper we are interested in the quality of a lineup plot. In visual inference, the actual plot is the test statistic and the lineup plot is the null distribution. Unlike classical inference, the null distribution is represented by the 19 null plots that we obtain randomly from the actual plot assuming that the null hypothesis is true. So the decision of rejection or failure of rejection of the null hypothesis is heavily dependent on these 19 null plots. This induces us to take a closer look at the null plots. For this purpose, we calculate different distance matrices between the null plots and the actual plot to get a measure on how close is each null plot to the actual plot. We also calculate the distance matrices between the null plots to see how close are the null plots to each often. Finally a percentile value is calculated to find how often such a distance appears in a lineup and a z-score of the different distances is calculated to get a measure on the closeness between the null plot and the actual plot and also compare between two different lineups.  

%In this paper we presents results of a human-subject study assessing the performance of the different distance matrices. Section~\ref{sec:visual_test} describes the basic idea of the visual inference and also gives the definition of the different distance measures. Section~\ref{sec:asso} and Section~\ref{user.distance} applies these ideas and uses the definitions to calculate the different distance measures. In Section~\ref{results} and Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we outline the setup and present results.

%\section{Visual Statistical Inference and Definitions} \label{sec:visual_test} 

%This section outlines the concepts of visual inference in comparison to the procedures of classical statistical inference and also gives the definition of the different distance measures. 

%Let $\theta$ be a population parameter of interest, with $\theta \in \Theta$, the parameter space. 
%Any null hypothesis $H_0$ then partitions the parameter space into $\Theta_0$ and $\Theta_0^c$, with $H_0: \theta \in \Theta_0$ versus $H_1: \theta \in \Theta_0^c$. 
% In hypothesis testing terminology, the parameter space $\Theta$ of a population parameter $\theta$, can be partitioned into $\Theta_0$ and $\Theta_0^c$. We test $H_0: \theta \in \Theta_0$ versus $H_1: \theta \in \Theta_0^c$.

%\subsection{Visual Statistic} 

%Unlike classical hypothesis testing, the statistic in visual inference is not a single value, but a plot that is appropriately chosen to describe the parameter of interest, $\theta$. When the alternative hypothesis is true, it is expected that the plot of the true data, the test statistic, will have visible feature(s) consistent with $\theta \in \Theta_0^c$, and that visual artifacts will not distinguish the test statistic as different when $H_1$ is not true.

%\begin{dfn}\label{dfn:lplot}
%A lineup plot is a layout of $m$ visual statistics, consisting of 
%\begin{itemize}\itemsep-3pt
%\item $m-1$ plots simulated from the model specified by $H_0$  (null plots) and 
%\item the test statistic produced by plotting the true data, possibly arising from $H_1$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{dfn}

%If $H_1$ is true, the test statistic is expected to be the plot that is most different from the other plots in the lineup plot. A careful visual inspection should reveal the differences in the feature shown by the test statistic under null and alternative hypothesis. {\em If the test statistic cannot be identified} in the lineup, the conclusion is to {\em not reject the null hypothesis.} The $(m-1)$ null plots can be considered to be samples drawn from the sampling distribution of the test statistic assuming that the null hypothesis is true. \\

%Since the lineup plot consists of $m$ plots, the probability of choosing any one of them is $1/m$. Thus we have a type-I error probability of $1/m$.

%\red{the next three paragraphs might be important, but you loose focus - you want to come as fast as possible to the problematic of the paper, e.g.:}
%The lineup plot can be evaluated by one or more individuals. When a single individual identifies the true graph in the lineup plot we report a $p$-value of at most $1/m$, otherwise the $p$-value is at least $1-\frac 1m$. 
%
%If $N$ individuals evaluate a lineup plot independently, we count the number of successful evaluations as $U \sim \text{Binom} (N,\frac{1}{m})$ and report a  $p$-value of at most $Pr(U \ge u)= \sum_{k \ge u}^N {{N \choose k} (\frac{1}{m})^k(1-\frac 1m)^{(N-k)}}$ where $u$ is the true number of successful evaluations. %Notice that when $N=1$, this $p$-value is $\frac1m$.  \\ 
%
%
%For two different visual test statistics of the same true data, the one  is better, in which a specific pattern is more easily distinguishable visually. \\ \\

%\red{Before distance measures are introduced, introduce the problem of why we look at these distances in the context of permutation tests. }
%The difference between a regular permutation test and a graphical test under the line-up protocol, is that we are comparing the true value of the test statistics (i.e. the plot of the true data) to a finite sample of the sample distribution.

%{\color{red} Things to add:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Null-generating mechanisms 
%\item Dependence on Question of Interest - in general should not be a problem because the question is ``which is different? ". But for data from Turk study, questions were quite focussed.
%\item Interplay between type of plot and distance metric - calculation on data vs graphical elements. For example, scatterplot vs reg line distance
%\item Distance metric distribution calculation eg permutation
%\item Selection of the number of bins
%\end{enumerate}}

\section{Experimental Data} \label{sec:expts}
Various experiments employing the lineup protocol have been conducted 
%There have been eleven experiments conducted
using Amazon's Mechanical Turk~\citep{turk} (MTurk), with some used for evaluating the power of visual inference against that of classical tests \citep{majumder:2011}, \hh{some for comparison of different designs \citep{hofmann2012graphical, loy:2015}, or for targeted conclusions based on visual inference \citep{tengfei:2013}.}
%and the others using the protocol for different purposes. 
It is possible to try the tasks provided to Turkers \citep{majumder:2013}. For evaluating the distance metrics we used the data collected on experiments~1, 2, and~7. Table \ref{tbl:visual_stat} describes the experiments.

%that are being used to evaluate the effects of observers' demographic factors on the inference. Table \ref{tbl:visual_stat} summarizes these experiments. Each of these experiments collected demographic details of the subjects. Experiments 5, 6 and 7 are used to study the learning trend of the observer. The design of experiment 9 incorporated components that allows position of the actual data plot in the lineup, and the sample of nulls, to be evaluated. Section~\ref{sec:factor_performance} discusses human factors that may affect the performance of the observer. Section~\ref{sec:exp_design} describes the methods used to assess the effects, and Section~\ref{sec:result_socio} describes the results.

\section{Null Generating Mechanism} \label{sec:null}

The lineup protocol embeds the true data plot among a set of null plots. The method of obtaining the data for these null plots is called the null generating mechanism. %These null plots are obtained from the null distribution in a method consistent with the null hypothesis. 
The null hypothesis directly affects the choice of null generating method. In the experimental data that we analyzed the null generating methods used were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Permutation:} Because of its versatility, this is a commonly used apporach. Permutation is used to break the association between two or more variables, and thus is appropriate when the null hypothesis is that there is no association. Consider two variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. Either $X_1$ or $X_2$ is permuted while keeping the other variable fixed. Any association between $X_1$ and $X_2$ is broken in the process altering the joint distribution between the variables, whereas the marginals of $X_1$ and $X_2$ remains the same. The method works in situations where one or both the variables are continuous or categorical. Let us consider a case where we have one categorical variable, say, Group and a continuous variable. Let us assume that the variable Group has two levels (say, A and B) and we want to test whether there is any significant difference between the two groups, i.e.\ $H_o: \mu_A = \mu_B$. To generate the null data, the values of the variable Group are permuted keeping the continuous variable fixed. If there is a difference between the two groups, this difference is broken by the permutation, and any difference observed in the permuted data is consistent with random variation.
\item {\bf Simulation under a null model:} Sometimes there is a model underlying the problem being studied. In this situation simulating from the model will be the null generating mechanism.  The parameter estimates are obtained from  fitting  the model to the true data. Data is then generated using the parameter estimates. Let us assume that we are interested in testing whether there is any significant linear relationship between two continuous variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. Hence, we test for $H_o : \beta_1 = 0$ versus $H_a: \beta_1 \ne 0$. Under the null hypothesis, we fit the following model to the data:
$$Y = \beta_0 + \varepsilon$$
where $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. The parameter estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\sigma^2$ are obtained and null data is generated from $N(\widehat{\beta_0}, \widehat{\sigma}^2)$. 
%\item \red{*** Not used by us, so exclude for now} Simulation from a specific distribution:  When the null hypothesis is that the data comes from a specific distribution, this distribution can be used to simulate new samples that generate the null plots. The parameters for the null distribution are obtained from the estimates calculated using the data. For example, suppose we want to test whether data comes from a Normal distribution, $H_o:$ data $\sim$ Normal vs. $H_A:$ data $\nsim$ Normal, then the null data are generated from the Normal distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to the estimated mean and standard deviation from the data. 
\end{enumerate} 

%Other null generating mechanisms might be utilized depending on the null hypothesis underlying a data plot. 

\section{Distance Measures} \label{sec:meas}

%\blue{The difference between a regular permutation test and a graphical test under the line-up protocol, is that we are comparing the true value of the test statistics (i.e. the plot of the original data) to a finite sample of the sample distribution. As Tukey suggested, `there is such a thing as a bad random sample' \citet{fernholz03}:
%\begin{quotation}
%There [in Tukey's Data Analysis class] I discovered that [...]  a random sample is indeed a ``batch of values" which ``fail to be utopian" most of the time.
%\end{quotation}
%
%To avoid basing our conclusion on artifacts introduced by a `bad' sample, we need to be aware of properties of this set of null plots. In this paper, we are proposing a set of  distance measures that help us in the evaluation of the goodness of a random sample. It also turns out, that these measures give us also some insight in the perceived difficulty of picking the original plot of the data from a particular line-up. 
%
%\subsection*{Distance Measures}
%}

%\red{The distance measures need some more setting up beforehand. I would actually include a small example of a set of scatterplots that highlights the problematic.}
%
%\red{Another thing that we should discuss on Friday is whether it might be better to call the measures we use norms rather than distances - a distance usually assumes the comparison of two objects, and we implicitly compare against null or identity, which is what a norm does..}

By calculating the ``distance'' between plots we may be able to determine if a lineup should be easy -- if the actual data plot is detectably different from the null plots -- and also to better understand what aspect of the plot people use to make their choice. It is not an easy task to measure the difference between plots. Here we examine several possibilities. 

The problem could be tackled by considering the data as a reference distribution, and compare all of the null sets with this reference. Comparing data with a reference probability distribution or comparing two datasets are common statistical tasks. For example, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test \citep{stephens:1974} sorts values in two samples, computes the empirical distribution function of each and compares these two, to determine if the two samples are likely to have come from the same distribution.  The Anderson-Darling \citep{stephens:1974} and Shapiro-Wilk \citep{shapiro:1965} tests compare datasets with normal probability distributions. These measure differences between univariate distributions which limits their applicability to distances between plots, generally. 

Hausdorff distance \citep{huttenlocher:1993} has been successfully used for comparing images. It effectively matches points between sets and computes the distances between the matched points. When permutation is the null generating mechanism, Hamming distance \citep{hamming:1950} can be used to calculate how different the permutations are, by measuring the minimum number of substitutions it takes to get from one permutation to another. 

Alternatively, interpoint distance metrics might be adapted to measure distances between plots. For example, when the purpose is differences between groups in a single plot, like side-by-side boxplots, a distance metric that focuses on group separation calculated on each data set might be useful. Bhattacharyya distance \citep{bhattacharyya:1946} is widely used in image processing, for feature extraction. The R package {\tt fpc} \citep{hennig:2010} contains many different ways to calculate distances between groups. 

Ultimately, a very simple binned distance was used in the analyses of the MTurk data, which worked fairly well in most circumstances. However, it was clear immediately that plot design, and the question asked, has a large impact on how a plot is read, and specific distance metrics designed for specific plot types and tasks are needed. Below is a summary of distance metrics used. For all of these distance measures, let $X$ denote the true dataset with one or two variables. Let $Y$ denote the null dataset obtained by using an appropriate null generating mechanism.

%Bhattacharyya distance \citep{bhattacharyya:1946} is used to compare two samples, . It has a wide use in image processing, feature extraction and selection and phone clustering. Mahalanobis distance \citep{mahalanobis:1936} is a special case in the sense that the same sets of variances and covariances are used. Similar interpoint distances are widely used in cluster analysis and classification techniques. On the other hand, Hamming distance  \citep{hamming:1950} measures the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different in two variables of equal length. This can be used to measure the distance between two datasets where only one variable is permuted and the other is constant.


%Some of the distance metrics are generic and uses the raw data to calculate the distances. They do not consider any graphical element in the plot which may somehow affect the decision of the subjects in identifying the true plot. A regression line overlaid on a scatterplot may affect the decision of a plot. Same can be done when a boxplot is used to represent the data instead of a dot plot. The distance metrics should take into account the presence of these graphical elements. Distance metrics like distance based on regression line, distance based on boxplots are designed to address this issue. \\

%\blue{For all of the distance measures below, let $P$ be a permutation mapping  the set $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$ onto itself. Let further $[P]$ denote the $n \times n$ matrix associated to permutation $P$.
%}
\begin{enumerate}

%\item Hamming Distance: The hamming distance $H$ of $P$ is defined as 
%\[
%H(P) := \sum_{i=1}^n I_{P(i) \neq i},  \text{ where } I_{x} = \left \{ 
%\begin{array}{ll}
%1 & \text{if } x \text{ is true},\\
%0 & \text{otherwise},

%Hamming distance between two equal length strings is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. 

%This distance matrix measures the distance between the permutation matrix and the identity and does not depend on the actual values of the variables $X$ and $Y$. 


%\blue{let $X$ be a continuous variable. The Euclidean Distance under permutation is then defined as 
%%\red{we need a good short-cut for this distance}

%\[

%Euclidean Distance between two equal length strings measure the distance between the permuted values of one variable and the original continuous variable while the other variable, either continuous or categorical, remains unaltered. This distance matrix takes into  account the actual values of the variable that is permuted and does not depend on the values of the other variable. 

\item {\bf Binned Distance (BN):}
%\red{write out mathematically, include all definitions - i.e. C(X,Y) needs to be defined - have a look at the grammar of graphics}
Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be two continuous variables. Let $X_1$ be divided into $p$ bins and $X_2$ divided into $q$ bins. % $(i,j)$-th cell represents the $j$-th bin of $X_2$ corresponding to the $i$-th bin of $X_1$. 
 Let $C(X_1,X_2)$ be defined as a $p \times q$ matrix \hh{consisting of the binned frequency of the joint distribution of $X_1$ and $X_2$, i.e.\ the $(i,j)$-th element of the matrix represents the cell count of the number of points falling in this cell.}
 %. Each $(i,j)$-th element of the matrix represents the number of points falling in the $(i,j)$-th cell, where $i = 1, \dots, p$ , $j = 1, \dots, q$.
The BN distance is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}\nonumber
d_{\hbox{BN}}^2 (X, Y) &:=& ||C_X(X_1, X_2) - C_Y(X_1,X_2)||^2 \\ &=& \sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^q (C_X(X_{1i},X_{2j}) - C_Y(X_{1i},X_{2j}))^2.\label{eq:BNdist}

%\red{careful: $C(X,[P]Y)$ is not the same as $C_{i,P(j)}$. $C_{i,j}$ is the count for points falling into cell $i,j$ - it's not enough to permute the grid counts, we need to get the grid counts of the permuted variable. Introduce $C$ as a function of $X$ and $Y$ ....}

% To calculate this distance, we form a $p \times q$ grid between the two continuous variable and count the number of points falling to each grid. Then we permute one continuous variable keeping the other variable unchanged and repeat the above procedure. The euclidean distance between the counts for the original and permuted data gives an measure of the binned distance. Binned distance takes into account both the variables but only one of the variables is permuted. Binned distance considers only the count for each respective bin and puts no weight on the counts of the neighboring bin.

%\item Weighted Bin Distance: Using the same setup of the binned distance, the weighted bin distance is defined as 
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%d_{\hbox{wbin}}^2(X, Y) &:=&||W_X(X_1,X_2) - W_Y(X_1,X_2))||^2 \\ &=& \sum_{i=1}^n (W_X(X_{1i},X_{2i}) - W_Y(X_{1i},X_{2i}))^2 , 
%\end{eqnarray*}
%where $W(X_{1i},X_{2i})$ denotes the joint (empirical) density of $X_1$, $X_2$ at location $(X_{1i}, X_{2i})$. See Figure~\ref{fig:test_category} for a comparison of weighted and unweighted binned distance at the example of 20  points.
%%The weighted bin distance is an improvement to the bin distance where a weight is provided to the counts of the neighboring bins. The weight is done by doing a kernel density estimation of the different bins.
%
%%\green{I wrote something down here but I am not sure if this works.}
%
%
%\item Hausdorff distance: Let $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$ be two sets of points. The Hausdorff distance between $X$ and $Y$ is defined as
% \[
%d_{\hbox{hausdorff}}(X, Y)  = max (h(X, Y), h(Y, X))
%\]
%where 
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%h(X, Y) &:=& \max_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} ||x - y|| \\ & = & \max_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}
%\end{eqnarray*}
%
%This measure is computationally intensive.
%
%\end{itemize}

This distance can be calculated for univariate continuous data, bivariate data with two categorical variables, or data with one continuous and one categorical variable. For a categorical variable, we choose the number of bins  equal to the number of categories.

Binned distance is highly susceptible to small differences in values and depends on the number of bins as well as the anchor position. It is necessary to find the optimal number of bins in each direction. For our purposes `optimal' was defined as the number of bins that produced the most detectable difference to the observed data plot. The distance was measured between the observed data plot, and the closest null, and compared with the biggest distance between any pair of null plots. Details of these choices on various different data sets can be found in the Appendix.

Several variations to this distance are possible, such as a change to using kernel density estimates, a change from $L_2$ to $L_p$ based distance, or using transformations on the counts. 
\hh{XXX should the next sentence go into the discussion/conclusions?}

Hausdorff distance \citep{huttenlocher:1993} was investigated as a generic distance metric as well, but the binned distance was faster to calculate and performed as well as the Hausdorff as a rough, generic measure of similarity of plots.

%The remaining distance measures are different from the ones above, in that they are used to directly draw inference on a linear association between variables $X$ and $Y$, whereas the other ones were not specifically tailored to this purpose.

%\blue{The remaining distance measures are different from the ones above, in that they are used to directly draw inference on a linear association between variables $X$ and $Y$, whereas the other ones were not specifically tailored to this purpose.}
%The remaining distance measures are different from the ones above, in that they are used for specific plot types and cannot be used for any type of data. The following distance measures uses the graphical element to calculate the distances.

%\begin{itemize}
% Univariate distance is NOT USED in your examples
%\item Distance for univariate data: Let $X$ be a continuous variable. Then the distance metric is given by
%\[
%d^2_{\hbox{uni}}(X, Y) := ||m(X) - m(Y)||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^4 ((m(X))_i - (m(Y))_i)^2
%\]
%where $m(.)$ is a vector of the mean, the standard deviation, the skewness and the kurtosis of the variable. This distance metric works for univariate distributions using only the graphical elements in the plot.


\item {\bf Distance based on boxplots (BX):} 
Let $X_1$ be a categorical variable representing $J$ groups in the data and $X_2$ be a continuous variable. 

Define $d_q(.)$ as a three dimensional vector giving the absolute maximal difference of the first quartile, median and the third quartile of $X_2$ between the groups in $X_1$. 

Then the distance metric is given by
 \begin{equation}\nonumber
d^2_{\hbox{BX}}(X, Y) := || d_q(X) - d_q(Y)||^2 \\=
\sum_{i=1}^3 \left( d_q(X)_i - d_q(Y)_i\right)^2. \label{eq:BXdist}
\end{equation}

This distance measure works specifically for boxplots and is based on only their graphical elements. 
This distance is based on the assumption that %after the boxplots have already been constructed, the 
subjects only consider the difference in the boxes to make the distinction. Variations on this might include adding whiskers' values, (number of) outliers, or including higher-order letter values \citep{tukey:1977, lvplot}. 

\item {\bf Distance based on the regression line (RG):}
Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be two continuous variables. $X_1$ and $X_2$ are plotted in a scatterplot and assume that the scatterplot is binned vertically into $b$ bins. \hh{XXX in the package, the binning is horizontal. }
\hh{XXX how are these bins motivated? what kind of example do you have in mind? }
In each vertical bin, a linear regression model is fitted and the regression coefficients. i.e.\ intercept and slope are estimated. The distance metric based on the regression coefficients is given as
 \begin{eqnarray}\nonumber
d^2_{\hbox{RG}}(X, Y) := \hbox{tr} (B(X) - B(Y))' (B(X) - B(Y))  \\
= \sum_{i=1}^b ((b_0(X))_i - (b_0(Y))_i)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^b ((b_1(X))_i - (b_1(Y))_i)^2\label{eq:drg}
\end{eqnarray}
\hh{XXX intercept and slope could be on very different scales.  On what kind of examples did you try this distance out? 
XXX I think we should try to scale X and Y to the same scale first. }

where $b_0$ and $b_1$ denote the vector of the intercept and slope respectively while $b$ is the number of bins. $B(.)$ is a $b \times 2$ matrix of the regression coefficients where each row represent the  intercept and the slope obtained from each bin. The number of bins have a significant effect on the distance measure. It can be seen that it works best for smaller number of bins like 1 or 2. 
With larger number of bins (i.e. smaller bin sizes), the regression coefficients are affected by the skewness of the data. Variations might include using slope alone, or absolute value of slope. \hh{XXX are regression coefficients really affected by skewness or is it sparseness? What is the sample size of the examples that you tried?}

\item {\bf Distance based on separation between multiple groups (MS, AS, WL):}
\hh{XXX is the distance WL or CM? }
Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be two continuous variable. Let $X_3$ be a categorical variable providing the groups associated with each variable. $X_1$ and $X_2$ are plotted in a scatterplot colored by the group variable $X_3$. The separation can be described in a number of different ways. Two versions are used in this paper. \hh{XXX two versions or three? } %Let us define, 

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] {\bf Minimum separation:} let  $s_{m}(.)$ be a vector of the minimum distance of a point in the cluster to a point in any of the other $g-1$ clusters. 
The distance metric based on minimal separation is then defined as
\[
d^2_{\hbox{MS}}(X, Y):= ||s_m(X) - s_m(Y)||^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^g ((s_m(X))_i - (s_m(Y))_i)^2
\]

\item[(ii)] {\bf Average point separation:} let $s_{a}(.)$ be a vector of cluster wise average distances of all the points in the cluster to all points in all other $g-1$ clusters. The distance metric based on average separation is defined as
\[
d^2_{\hbox{AS}}(X, Y):= ||s_a(X) - s_g(Y)||^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^g ((s_a(X))_i - (s_a(Y))_i)^2
\]

\item[(iii)] {\bf Cluster mean separation:} let $m_i(.) = \left(\bar{X_1}^i, \bar{X_2}^i\right)$ be the mean of the $i$-th cluster, $i = 1, 2, \dots, g$. The distance metric based on the cluster means is given by
\[
d^2_{\hbox{CM}}(X, Y):= ||m(X) - m(Y)||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^g (m_i(X) - m_i(Y))^2
\]
\end{enumerate}
%\red{Now write the formula for the mean, since it is included below}

\hh{XXX Why are there so many variations for the cluster distance? There are obvious variations for the other distances mentioned, too - it would be more consistent to just pick one distance and run with it.}

Figure~\ref{sep-dist} illustrates the difference between the different distance metrics separation. In practice, many possible metrics could be used to measure the separation, such as those readily available in the {\tt fpc} package  \citep{hennig:2010}.

%Here the two methods are applied on two dimensional projections of a dataset with 60 dimensions and 30 observations with three classes. The same is done on the projections of the same dataset with permuted classes. The average separation calculates the euclidean distance between each point in one cluster to all the points in the other two clusters. For example, for the original data, the distance between the points in the green cluster and the other two clusters are calculated and then the average of these distances represent the average distance for the green cluster. Similarly, the average distances for the other two clusters are calculated. The minimum distance also calculates the euclidean distance between each point in one cluster to all the points in the other two clusters. But instead of taking the average, it looks at the minimum distance. For the original data, the minimum distance between any point in the green cluster and the other two clusters is the distance between the point and a point in the red cluster.

How well each distance measure matches the observers' responses depends some on the question of interest. But, in general, this should not be a problem because the question which is typically asked is ``Which plot among these is different?''. In the MTurk experiments, more focused questions were asked because the purpose was very specific, to compare visual inference with classical inference.

\hh{XXX still open questions after the first read-through: how are these distance metrics chosen, how well do they work in general situations? At the moment the distances seem like they are tailored for very specific examples in very specific designs.}

%\item $t$ statistic: In this paper we used the test statistic of a t-test based on the correlation coefficient $r$ where $$t =\frac{r \sqrt{n - 2}}{\sqrt{1 - r^2}}$$ where $n$ is the number of observations in $X$ or $Y$. This is the only measure that makes a distributional assumption that the ($X$,$Y$) follows approximately a bivariate Normal distribution. Hence the $t$-statistic follows a t distribution with ($n$ - 2) degrees of freedom.
%%\red{use either upper case or lower case $T$, not both. }
%%The first one was used when one variable is continuous and the other is categorical while the other is used when both the variables are continuous.  
%
%%\item Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test statistic: This is a nonparametric test statistic for assessing whether one of the two samples of independent observations tend to have larger values than the other. This is also used when one variable is continuous and the other is categorical.  
%
%\item Spearman's rank correlation $\rho$ : $\rho$ is a nonparametric alternative to the correlation coefficient with Kendall's $\tau$. $X$ and $Y$ are converted into the ranks $x$ and $y$. Assuming there are no ties in the data, the differences $d_i=x_i - y_i$ between the ranks of each observation between the two variables are calculated and $\rho$ is given as $$\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$ The Spearman's rank correlation is a better measure of correlation than the Pearson's rank correlation if the data contains some outliers. Kendall's $\tau$ is computationally intensive
%% - the naive implementation is $O(n^2)$, but it can be reduced to $O(n \log n)$, which is equivalent to sorting.}
%%takes huge time \red{could you be more specific - is it $O(n^2)$? - I think it can be brought down to $O(n \log n)$} \green{I think I used 2 for loops. So it should be $O(n^2)$. But I am not sure if it can be brought down to $O(n \log n)$}to calculate for an averaged size sample. 
%So in this paper we considered $\rho$ as the only nonparametric measure.
%%\red{which one of the statistics do you refer to?} 
%%\red{give a mathematical definition of $\rho$}
%$\rho$ uses both the variables. 
%
%
%\item Euclidean Distance of permutations: The Euclidean distance of permutations $P$ is 
%\[
%d^2_P(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n ( i - P(i))^2.
%\]
%where $i = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$
%
%
%\item Canberra Distance: Using exactly the same setup as the binned distance , the canberra distance under permutation is defined as
%%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\[
%c^2_P(X)  = \left \{ 
%\begin{array}{ll}
%\sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^q \frac{ |C_{X_i,Y_j} - C_{X_i,P(Y)_j}|}{ C_{X_i,Y_j} + C_{X_i,P(Y)_j}} & \text{if } C_{X_i,Y_j} + C_{X_i,P(Y)_j} > 0,\\
%0 & \text{otherwise},
%\end{array} \right.
%\]
%Like the binned distance, the canberra distance is also effected by the number of bins used. Here again we use the usual convention as the binned distance. Canberra distance is an improvement to the binned distance as it puts less weight on the bins which has a large number of points than the bins with fewer points. Visually it is difficult to differentiate between a single point and a number of points having the exact coordinates. Canberra distance has the same drawbacks as the binned distance. So we defined the weighted canberra distance which is a similar measure as the weighted bin distance.
%
%\item Weighted Canberra Distance:  Using the same setup of the weighted bin distance, the weighted canberra distance under permutation is defined as 
%%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\[
%wc_P^2(X) = \left \{ 
%\begin{array}{ll}
%\sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^q \frac{ |W_{X_i,Y_j} - W_{X_i,P(Y)_j}|}{ W_{X_i,Y_j} + W_{X_i,P(Y)_j}} & \text{if } W_{X_i,Y_j} + W_{X_i,P(Y)_j} > 0,\\
%0 & \text{otherwise},
%\end{array} \right.
%\] 
%%\end{eqnarray*}
%where like the weighted bin distance, $W_{X_i,Y_i}$ denotes the joint (empirical) density of $X$, $Y$ at location $(X_i, Y_i)$. 
%
%\item Correlation between $Y$ and $[P]Y$: Let $Y$ be a continuous variable.The correlation between the $Y$ and $[P]Y$ is defined as
%\[
%r_P(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y_i})(Y_{P(i)} - \bar{Y}_{P(i)})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y_i})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_{P(i)}- \bar{Y}_{P(i)})^2}}.

\section{Distance Metric Distribution} \label{sec:distri}

For a given lineup of size $m$, the empirical distribution of distance metrics is obtained using the following algorithm:

\begin{enumerate} \itemsep 0in
\item Calculate the distance between the true data and all the null datasets and take the average of these distances. 

\item For each of the ($m$ - 1) null datasets, calculate the distance between the null data and all the other ($m$ - 2) null datasets and obtain the average distance. Hence, we obtain ($m$ - 1) distances, one corresponding to each  null plot.

% \item Generate a null dataset from the true dataset by the null generating mechanism. Consider this null dataset as ``true'' dataset. From this ``true'' dataset, generate ($m$ - 2) null datasets and calculate the average distance between the ``true'' data and the null datasets. Hence obtain a distance corresponding to this ``true'' dataset. 

\item \hh{Generate a lineup of size $m$ using the null generating mechanism. 
Single out one of these nulls as the `data' plot, and calculate the distances as described in steps (1) and (2).  } Repeat this procedure $B$ times (where $B$ is large, usually on the order of 1,000 or 10,000).

\item Plot these $B$ distances to obtain the empirical distribution of the distance metric. Plot the distances for the true plot and the null plots to show the distances for the lineup \hh{under consideration}.

% \hh{XXX the paragraph below sounds like a re-do of the above algorithm, except that I just named the number of reps $B$. }
% The empirical distribution of the distance measures is obtained by calculating the distances between the null plots among themselves. One null data is generated from the true data set using the null generating mechanism. Assuming this null data to be the ``true'' data set, a number of null data sets are obtained from this null data and the distances between these datasets are calculated. One single distance value is obtained by averaging all these distances. This process is repeated a large number of times, say, $N$ where $N$ is a large number of the order $10^3$ or $10^4$. Finally $N$ mean distances or average distances are obtained which gives the empirical distribution of the distance. 

%The empirical distribution of the distance works as the $t$-distribution in the classical setting. In the classical setting, the test statistics follows a $t$-distribution under the null hypothesis. 
%Unlike the $t$-distribution in classical hypothesis tests, the empirical distribution in visual inference is generally skewed.

The observed test statistic is  compared to this distribution, as shown in Figure~\ref{compare}. 
%In visual inference, the mean distances of the null plots gives the empirical distribution. The mean distance of the true plot from the null plots in the lineup acts as the observed test statistic. 

%The mean distance between the true plot and the null plots in a lineup of size $m = 20$ is calculated by averaging over the distances between the true plot and each of the  $(m - 1)$ null plots. The mean distances for the $(m - 1)$ null plots in the lineup are calculated by taking the mean of the distances of the particular null plot and the other $(m - 2)$ null plots.

The distance measures for the true dataset and the null datasets are plotted on the empirical distribution. If the distance measure of the true plot is larger than any of the null plots, the lineup would be regarded as``easy''. Otherwise, it is a ``difficult'' lineup. 

The empirical distribution of the distance based on regression is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:distances}. To generate this distribution, $B = 1000$ simulation runs were done. 

Figure~\ref{dist_1} shows the lineup plot for $m = 20$ for testing whether there exists a significant linear relationship between $X_1$ and $X_2$. The 19 null plots are generated by fitting the null model and generating from the null model. Figure~\ref{dist_2} shows the general empirical distribution of distance measures based on the null model. For the particular lineup on the left, mean distances  are shown by overlaid line segments for the true plot (in orange) and the null plots (in black). The true plot is easily identifiable from the lineup (Figure~\ref{dist_1}, \hh{40 out of 45 observers identified the data}). This is backed by the regression based distance measure seen in Figure~\ref{dist_2}, as the orange line is on the extreme right tail compared to the black lines.

Figure~\ref{box-1} shows a lineup of size $m = 20$ for testing whether there exists a significant difference in the group medians between A and B. The 19 null plots are generated from a null model, consisting of draws from a normal distribution.  Figure~\ref{box-2} shows the empirical distribution of the distance based on the boxplots with the mean distance for the true plot (in orange) and the null plots (in black). It is hard to identify the true plot from the lineup. During the study, only 2 out of 26 observers picked the data plot, indicating little to no evidence of a deviation from the null hypothesis. This  is also evident from the boxplot based distance measure: the orange line corresponding to the true data is together with the mass of the black lines, one null plot exhibits a lot more signal than the true plot.

\section{Effect of Plot Type and Question of Interest } \label{sec:plot_type}

Previous studies have suggested that the type of plot used in the lineup has an effect on the response of the subjects \citep{zhao:2012, hofmann2012graphical}. For example,  subjects find it easier to identify the true plot for a large sample data when a box plot is used in the lineup instead of a dot plot. Similarly, the use of aesthetics, such as colors or shapes, and graphical elements, such as a trend line, also influence an observer's decision \citep{vanderplas:2016}. In order to account for this, the distance metric has to be adjusted for the plot type and graphical elements. 
%The distance metric should account for the additional information provided by the graphical elements in the lineup. The graphical elements, like the presence of a box or a regression line overlaid on a scatterplot may influence the response of the subject. 
Figure~\ref{plottype} illustrates this idea.

Figure~\ref{sca:type_1} shows a lineup of scatterplots with 100 points between two variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. Figure~\ref{sca:type_2}, on the other hand, gives a lineup of the same scatterplots with the regression line overlaid. The overlaid regression lines are likely to help observers in identifying the panel with the steepest slope.
%Showing Figure~\ref{type_1}, if the subjects are asked to identify the plot which has the steepest slope, then the subjects probably will face some difficulty in identifying the true plot. But in Figure~\ref{type_2}, the regression line overlaid makes it easier for the subjects to identify the true plot. 
A different distance metric should be used in each case to correctly measure the quality of the lineup.
\hh{XXX the goal this needs to be stated more clearly. I am not quite sure at this point of why we are trying to get the distance measures to reflect the choice so closely. I think this is getting into fighting wind mills - we can't win this one. }

The question posed to observers plays an important role in the decision they make. A minor change in the question can change the response of the subject. For example,  if  subjects are asked to identify the plot  from on of the lineups in Figure~\ref{fig:sca}, in which there is the strongest positive relationship between the variables, plot \#2 exhibits the strongest signal.  If the question asks for the plot with the largest slope, plot \#7 should be the obvious pick. 
\hh{XXX again, why do we try to reflect a plot in a single number, when we know that we can't?}
A distance metric should also take into account the question of interest. But, in general, the question of interest is which plot among these is different.

\hh{XXX it matters what kind of comparisons those distance measures are supposed to allow. Internally, when the same design is used, the measures are consistent - and alow for a relative comparison: an easier lineup will show a bigger positive distance between the true plot and the nulls than a more difficult one. The distance measure does not necessarily allow for an absolute assessment of difficulty. When the comparison is additionally supposed to distinguish between designs showing the same data, the distance measures definitely need to take the graphical elements used into account. }

\section{Metric Evaluation} \label{sec:eval}
%
For a lineup of size $m = 20$, the average distance of the true plot from all null plots is compared 18 average distances between the null plots. This comparison can sometimes complicate things. A logical solution is to calculate a single statistic for each lineup. Such a statistic should be based on the mean distance of the true plot and the maximum of the mean distances for the null plots. Hence we define, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Difference:} let $\bar{d}_.$ be the average difference of plot $.$ to all of the (other) null plots. We define the difference between the mean distance for the true plot and the maximum of the mean distances for the null plots as a measure of lineup difficulty, more specifically, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:delta}
\delta(\ell) = \bar{d}_{\text{data}} - \max_j \left(\bar{d}_{\text{null}_j}\right)
\end{equation}
for $j = 1, \dots, (m  - 1)$ 
defines the lineup difference for lineup $\ell$.
 A positive difference  indicates that the mean distance of the true plot is larger than the maximum of the mean distances of the null plots. Hence the true plot is more extreme compared to the set of null plots in the lineup. A larger difference should make a data plot identification easier. 
 Similarly, a negative difference indicates that there is at least one null plot which is more extreme compared to the true plot based on the distance metric.
 
The issue with this statistic is that $\delta$ indicates an ``easy" or ``difficult" lineup only on the basis of whether it is positive or negative, although it may be really close to 0.
\hh{XXX why should we base the decision on difficulty on the sign only? Shouldn't the absolute value of the difference also taken into account?}



However, this statistic does not imply how many null plots are more extreme than the true plot. So we define,
\item {\bf \hh{Number of Extreme Nulls}:}  the number of null plots which have larger mean distances than the mean distance of the true plot is noted. Mathematically, for lineup $\ell$, we define the $\gamma$-number as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nullcount}
\gamma(\ell) = \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} 1\!\!\hbox{I}\left({\bar{d}_{\text{null}_j} > \bar{d}_{\text{data}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\mathds{1}(.)$ is a zero/one indicator function.
% where 
% \begin{equation}
% a_j =
% \begin{cases}
% 1 & \text{if } \bar{d}_{\hbox{null}_j} > \bar{d}_{\hbox{true}} ,
% \\
% 0 & \text{otherwise}
% \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
$\gamma(.)$ takes integer values between 0 and $(m - 1)$. The higher this value, the more null plots are more extreme than the true plot and hence the data plot is harder to identify from the lineup.
\end{enumerate}

\hh{XXX why don't you also use the distribution of the null distances that you created? That should give an empirical $p$-value for the data plot - it does not, however, take the dependency on the nulls into account.}

\section{Comparison of the distance metrics}


The difference and detection rate can be divided as following:

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|cc}
\hline
 & Detection Rate $>$ 0.05 & Detection Rate $<$ 0.05\\ 
  \hline
Difference $>$ 0  & $n_{11}$ & $n_{12}$\\
Difference $<$ 0 & $n_{21}$ & $n_{22}$\\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\hh{XXX what about including a neutral zone? Difference $> c$ means detection, difference $< -c$ means no detection, and in between we admit that it could go either way? That would reflect what we see in practice a bit closer, and we could try to estimate $c$. another approach would be to fit a logistic regression it should have an inflection point in 0, and the slope would be indicative of the predictive value of the difference on detection. }
The best scenario would be when $n_{12} = n_{21} = 0$. This will mean that the detection rate perfectly matches with the difference.  For each distance metric, we estimate the odds ratio
$$ \frac{(n_{11} + 0.5)(n_{22} + 0.5)}{(n_{12} + 0.5)(n_{21} + 0.5)}$$
A larger value of this ratio would indicate that the distance metric matches more to the response of the human subjects. 
\hh{XXX we would hope this to be at least positive to indicate some positive relationship between difference and detection rate. 
}

\hh{XXX the paper never comes back to the odds ratio or any of the $n_{11}, n_{12}, ...$ frequencies. It might be better to work this section into the end of the last section.}

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

%{\color{blue} Description of the Turk Results and analysis.}

The performance of the distance metrics was evaluated by comparing  distances to observers' responses. A number of experiments were run using the MTurk service \citep{turk}. Subjects were recruited through this service and were shown a sequence of lineups. In each experiment, they were asked specific questions. Their responses were recorded along with other demographic informations. Details on the design of experiments can be found in \cite{majumder:2011} and \cite{roychowdhury:2013}. 

\hh{XXX above paragraph could be tightened up a bit}
\hh{XXX still missing - what is the plan for this section?}
\hh{XXX plan seems to be: discuss evaluation metrics at the example of three turk studies. }

\subsection{Turk Experiment 1 -- Side by Side Boxplots}

\hh{XXX we've had this information earlier}
In this experiment, all the lineups generated had a side by side boxplot as the test statistic. Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, the null plots were generated by assuming that there is no difference between the two distributions.
\hh{XXX too vague}
The subjects were shown a few lineups and were asked to identify the plot which has the largest vertical difference between group 1 and group 2. 

The type of lineup used in this experiment is shown in Figure~\ref{box-1}.

%Figure~\ref{turk1} gives such a lineup. \\

The lineup has $m = 20$ plots of which one is the observed data plot and the remaining $m - 1$ are the null plots generated assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Subjects were asked to identify the plot which has the largest vertical difference between the two groups. Can you identify the observed data plot?}
% \label{turk1}
% \end{figure}

For each lineup the subjects' choice was noted and the proportion of data identifications was calculated. The distances between the plots in each lineup were computed using both the distance based on boxplots ($d_{BX}$) and the binned distance ($d_{BN}$). For each lineup the mean distance for the true plot and the null plots were calculated and $\delta$ and $\gamma$ are obtained. The proportion of data identification is plotted against each of the two statistics, shown in Figure~\ref{turk1comp}. Binned distance was calculated using 8 bins on both of the axes. %shows the detection rate against the difference for $d_{BX}$ and $d_{BN}$ and the number of null plots greater than the observed plot for the two distance measures.

%\newpage

In Figure~\ref{turk1comp},  detection rate is plotted against $\delta$-difference. The  vertical line highlights a  difference of 0 indicating that the mean distance of the true plot is equal to the maximum of the mean distance of the null plots i.e.\ the mean distance of the true plot is equal to at least one of the mean distance of the null plots. As the $\delta$-difference increases, detection rate generally increases. %So the subjects do better in the easier lineups than the hard ones. 
\hh{The thick lines in Figure~\ref{fig:turkcomp-1} are fits  from  logistic regression models using a quadratic effect for distance.
The fitted lines come very close to the non-parametric smooth shown by the thin line. Qualitatively, both boxplot based distance and binned distance show very similar fits for detection rate. Based on the logistic regressions, boxplot distance is fitting detection rate a bit better (AIC: \Sexpr{round(AIC(dbx),1)}) than binned distance  (AIC: \Sexpr{round(AIC(dbn),1)}). }

 Figure~\ref{turk1comp} also shows the relation between detection rate and the number of null plots larger than the true plot. As the number of plots that are more extreme than the data plot increases,  subjects find it more and more  difficult to pick the data plot. It is interesting to see that subjects are able to  pick the data plot even if there are  one or two more extreme null plots. 


Though  distance based on  boxplots works better a bit better, the binned distance does a decent job in this case. According to the binned distance, there are a few lineups with a negative difference, in which nevertheless the data plot is identified in more than 60\% of all evaluations (see also Figure~\ref{turk1comp}). It should be noted that the binned distance does not take any graphical elements of the plot (such as the box or whiskers) into account but calculates distance solely based on the data. So outliers may have a huge effect on the binned distance but might not affect the distance based on the boxplots. 
\hh{XXX the following sentence is a bit hard to swallow. XXX the case against one single distance needs to be built up more slowly. }
Hence it is advisable to use a distance based on the graphical elements since that is exactly what the subjects look at in the lineup.

The time subjects  take to respond  is another measure that can be used to evaluate  difficulty of lineups. 
Due to the presence of some huge outliers, we decided to use the median of time taken for each lineup. These values are plotted against  $\delta$-difference for both distance measures as shown in Figure~\ref{turk1-mtime}.
\hh{Both $\delta$-difference exhibit a similar pattern: the time to respond peaks at a $\delta$-difference of zero. This indicates, that the situation where two or more plots exhibits similarly extreme features is the most difficult for observers to judge. With negative $\delta$-differences at least one null plot is more extreme, and observers seem to be able to make their choice quickly (probably for the extreme null plot).}
%It can be clearly seen that when $\delta$-difference is below 0, there is no real trend in the mean time and there is a huge variability, indicating that the time taken depends on the subjects.
%\hh{XXX variability doesn't change that much over $x$; XXX for boxplot based distance the time to respond peaks at a $\delta$-difference of zero. This might indicate, that this situation is the most difficult for observers to judge. When there are more extreme plots, observers seem to be able to make their choice quickly (probably for the extreme null plot).}
When $\delta$-difference is positive, the median time to respond decreases rapidly as $\delta$-difference increases. Hence, subjects are able to make their choice of a plot more quickly if the true plot is extreme compared to the null plots.

\hh{Note that taking the log of time to respond is an alternative to using the median. Qualitatively, the relationships to distance metrics are very similar for median and log time taken, but median time is much easier to interpret. }

% \hh{XXX I don't think that the following statement is true -- there is no reason, why boxplot distance and binned distance should be on the same scale. }
% For Turk 1 experiment, the value of the ratio for boxplot distance is 86.52 and for binned distance is 18.82. This indicates that the boxplot distance works better than the binned distance.

%The lineup in Figure~\ref{turk1-exp} is a lineup of side-by-side boxplots.
\hh{The observed data plot is Plot \#20, which has been picked most often by participants, but there are other plots that are being chosen quite frequently. Plot \#16 is the plot with the  largest boxplot distance. This is reflected by the large number of times this plot has been singled out by observers. 

Maybe surprisingly, plots Plots \#19 and \#15, which have relatively large differences between the quartiles, are not being chosen by many participants. Instead, observers seem to focus on the difference in interquartile ranges (i.e.\ the height of the box in a  boxplot). Plots \#1, \#13 and \#16 exhibit a large interquartile difference and are being picked often by observers.}

%\hh{XXX the distributions for the distances seems to be off by the standard deviation setting in the simulation. It should be sd=12, which is what the lower row of density plots is using. Given the lineup they look more realistic to me than the upper row - given the small difference in the medians, the distance measures should not be very extreme. This would make a good example for using the empirical $p$-values as a more objective measure of lineup difficulty. }

\subsection{Turk Experiment 2 -- Scatterplots with an Overlaid Regression Line}

In this experiment, the test statistic is a scatterplot with the regression line overlaid. Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, the null plots are generated by assuming that there is no significant linear relationship between the two variables. The subjects were shown a set of ten lineups each and were asked to identify the plot with the steepest slope. 
% Figure~\ref{lineup-example,dist,turk2} show example lineups.

The distances between the plots in this experiment were computed using both the distance based on regression line ($d_{RG}$) and the binned distance ($d_{BN}$) with a small number of bins. The proportion of correct response for each lineup was calculated from the response of the subjects and plotted against $\delta$ and $\gamma$.  Figure~\ref{turk2comp} shows the results for the distance based on the regression line and the binned distance against $\delta$.

Figure~\ref{turk2comp-1} shows the detection rate against $\delta$-difference. The vertical line represents difference equal to 0. It can be seen that as the difference increases, the detection rate increases. So the subjects do better in the easier lineups than the hard ones. The distance based on regression works well in capturing the complexity of the lineups. The difference is positive for lineups with large differences and negative for lineups with small difference. A few lineups have difference close to zero for which the detection rate is close to 50\%.

But the binned distance fails terribly. Although the detection rate increases with difference, the detection rate is high for values with negative difference. This is a classic scenario where a graphical element affects the response. The presence of the overlaid regression line on almost transparent points of the scatterplot affected the response of the subjects. One other reason may be the use of the same number of bins (2 $\times$ 2) in this case for all the lineups. The relationship may improve if different number of bins can be used for different lineups.

Figure~\ref{turk2comp} also shows the detection rate against the number of null plots greater than the observed plot. As the number of plots greater than the observed plot increases, the detection rate decreases.  Hence as there are more extreme null plots compared to the observed plot, the subjects find it difficult to pick the observed plot. For a few lineups, almost all the subjects identify the observed plot although there is one more extreme null plot. Though from Figure~\ref{turk2comp}, it can be seen that the extremeness is marginal in most cases.

Figure~\ref{turk2-mtime} shows the relationship between the median time taken to respond and $\delta$-difference for both the distances. It can be clearly seen that there is a strong negative association showing that as the difference increases, the subjects take less time to respond. Also the variability of the mean time is higher for smaller difference. In case of binned distance, the relationship is negative though the variability is higher for the above mentioned reasons.

Although the regression based distance seems to efficiently identify the quality of the lineup, there is one lineup (marked by a solid triangle in Figure~\ref{turk2comp}) which had a negative difference although people identified the true plot with reasonable success.  Figure~\ref{turk2-exp} shows the lineup and the distributions of different distance metrics.

The lineup in Figure~\ref{turk2-exp} is a difficult one as suggested by the distribution of the distance metrics based on regression. Although around 28\% of the people identified the true plot correctly, the conventional $p$-value for testing the slope equal to 0 is 0.085, which shows that the relationship is not significant. The binned distance with 2 bins on each axes also shows the same. However the binned distance using the optimal number of bins (8 on the x-axis and 2 on the y-axis) by the optimal number of bins selection method identifies the true plot as different from the others.

%Figure~\ref{rel-pval} shows the relative frequency for each plot in the lineup versus the $p$-value. As the $p$-value increases, the relative frequency decreases. Hence there were few null plots which had signal stronger or of similar strength to the true plot and hence the responses were divided. The binned distance and distance based on the regression line does a good job considering this. 




\subsection{Turk Experiment 7 -- Large $p$, Small $n$ Data}

The motivation behind this experiment is to study the effect of large dimensions in a data with complete noise and some real separation. Data was simulated with different dimensions and fixed sample size. Data was divided into two or three groups. A projection pursuit with Penalized Discriminant Analysis Index was used and the one and two dimensional projections were obtained. The one or two dimensional projections were then plotted which resulted in the observed data plot. To generate the null data, the group variable in the data was permuted and the projection pursuit was applied. The subjects were shown these lineups and were asked to identify the plot with the most separated colored groups. Figure~\ref{largep} gives an example of such a lineup with two dimensional projections with 3 colored groups.

The distances between the plots in this experiment were computed using the distance based on minimum separation and average separation of the clusters and also the binned distance. The number of bins used for the lineups with one dimensional projections is larger (10 in this case) but for the lineups with two dimensional projections, the number of bins used is 5. The proportion of correct response is plotted against $\delta_{\hbox{lineup}}$ and $\gamma_{\hbox{lineup}}$ for both the distances. Figure~\ref{lp-comp} shows the results.

The red vertical line shows difference equal to 0.  It can be seen that as the difference increases, the detection rate increases and both the distances do a good job in capturing the response of the subjects.  In (b) it can be seen that as there are more extreme null plots compared to the observed plot, the subjects find it difficult to pick the observed plot. For a few lineups, a large number of the subjects identify the observed plot although there is more extreme null plots.

Figure~\ref{lp-exp} shows the lineup in a high dimension, low sample size setting. The number of dimensions used is 100 and two of the dimensions have some separation. Plot 20 shows the two-dimensional projections of the original data. The null plots are obtained by permuting the group variable and plotting the two dimensional projections obtained from a projection pursuit with PDA index (\cite{lee:2009}). Since the true plot has real separation, it is expected that the subjects would be able to identify the plot. The distance based on average separation yields a negative difference showing that the lineup is difficult, while the distance based on minimum separation yields a positive difference. The distance metrics identifies different characteristics in a plot. The average separation looks at the average of the distances of the points in a cluster to the points in other clusters. The presence of an outlier point in the opposite side of the other clusters affects this distance considerably. On the other hand, the minimum separation looks at the minimum of the distances. Hence it is not affected by the outlier point. 


\section{Conclusion}

Distance metrics are compared to the response of human subjects on lineups. They are comparable to a certain extent except in certain situations where they disagree. There seems to be various reasons behind the disagreement. When people look at a lineup, they may identify a plot as different from the others due to various reasons. But the distance metrics are constructed such that it takes into specific properties of the plot. 

Distance metrics can be used to measure the quality of a lineup before showing the lineups to human subjects. Hence the distance metrics allows us to provide a range of lineups to the human subjects to evaluate.

In classical inference, the test statistic under null hypothesis follows a certain distribution. Similarly the null plots in visual inference can also be assumed to be random samples from a sampling distribution. Though theoretically this is true, practically it is impossible to investigate such a distribution. The distribution of the distance metrics approximates such a sampling distribution for a given distance metric. The value of the distance metric for the actual plot can be compared to all the other plots using such a distribution.

The reason of choice can provide a way of evaluating the performance of a distance metric. For example, for a lineup of scatterplots with regression line overlaid, if the choice of reason for majority is steepest slope, the regression based distance may work better than the binned distance. Similarly if the reason of choice is presence of outliers, the binned distance with large number of bins on both axes may be the best distance metric. This can be a probable future work.

%The lineup protocol places a statistical plot in the hypothesis testing framework. The null plots in the lineup has an instrumental effect on the response of the subjects since there are only a finite number of null plots which the subjects compare the observed data plot to. A `bad' set of null plots makes it difficult to identify the observed data plot. The quality of the lineup is measured by describing plots numerically using a set of distance metrics. 

%A number of existing distance metrics are studied. Most of these metrics use the raw data to calculate the distances. A number of distance measures are suggested which takes the graphical elements into account. The graphical elements in a plot of a lineup affects the response of the subjects. So considering the graphical elements in the distance metric calculation seems logical.

%Unlike classical inference, the test statistic in visual inference is not a number, it is a plot. Hence it is not possible to obtain the distribution of the test statistics in visual inference. The empirical distribution of the distance metrics relates to the $t$-distribution followed by the test statistic in the classical inference framework. The distance for the observed data plot is compared to the empirical distribution and also the null plots obtained in the lineup. This provides a good idea about how extreme the observed plot is compared to the nulls.

%Comparing the observed data plot to the null plots may sometime complicate things. A single measure of the quality of a lineup is easy to interpret. Two measures are developed: the first one being the difference between the mean distance of the observed data plot and the maximum of the mean distances of the null plots and the second being the number of null plots which are more extreme than the true plot.


 
%\section{People's pick method}\label{user.distance}
%
%To explore how well the various distance measures matched visual characteristics of the lineup,  we conducted a human subject's experiment. For the scatterplot example, each participant was given 5 lineups similar to that in Figure~\ref{sca_1}. The participant was asked (1) which of the plots exhibited the strongest positive association between the variables, and then after revealing the location of the true data plot,  (2) the participants were asked to identify the plots that looked the most similar to the true data plot. There were 15 participants.  It is the second evaluation, on the closeness of the null plots to true data plot, that we focused on. Most people provided 2-3 closeness picks.  Because we didn't specifically request participants to order their closeness picks, we combined the picks, putting more emphasis if the plot was listed as the first or second, than if they were of the second or third choices:

%Based on these ranks we define percentages for the {\it people's pick} as follows:

%\red{Describe how the data looks like. Then describe how we can use the data to get a user defined 'closeness' or distance.} \green{I am not sure what to write here.}

%\green{For each lineup and each participant, we recorded their choice of the true plot and the "close" plots to the true. On the basis of their responses, we calculated the proportion of first 4 choices of the participants as follows:

% as the number of participants who chose the plot which appeared most in their first choices over the number of participants who responded. The proportion of second choice of the participants was defined as the number of participants which appeared the second most time over the number of people who responded their first two choices but did not choose the plot of the first choice. 

%We define
%\[
%\hbox{People's pick} = \frac{2}{3} p_{1,2} + \frac{1}{3} p_{2,3}
%\]
%where $p_{1,2}$ is the proportion of participants listing the plot  in the first or second place in the list and $p_{2,3}$ is the proportion of participants listing the plot in the second or third place.
%
%%Let the proportion of the first choice of the participants be defined as
%%\[
%%p_1 = \frac{m_1}{n_1}
%%\]
%%where $m_1$ is the number of participants who chose the plot which appeared the most frequent times in the first choice and $n_1$ is the number of participants who responded in the first choice.
%%For $i = 2, \dots, 4$, the proportion $p_i$ of the $i$-th choice of the participant  is defined as
%%\[
%%p_i = \frac{m_i}{n_i}
%%\]
%%where $m_i$ is the number of participants who chose the plot which appeared the most frequent times in the first $i$ choices but not the plot which matches the $(i-1)$-th choice and $n_i$ is the number of participants who reported at least  $i$ choices.

%\section{Example, using dotplots} \label{sec:diff}
%
%Consider a dataset with one variable which is essentially continuous. This variable is divided into two groups. Let us call these two groups as Group A and Group B. We can look this dataset as a dataset consisting of two variables, one of which is a continuous variable and the other is a categorical variable with two levels. Now we want to know whether the values of the continuous variable in Group B are generally higher than the values of the continuous variable in Group A. To test this we generate a dot-plot with the two groups represented with two different colors. If the values of the continuous variable for Group B are higher than that for Group A, the dot-plot shows a vertical displacement between the two colored groups. \\
%A lineup including this test statistic is shown in Figure~\ref{lineup_dot}. The 19 null plots are generated by permuting the categorical variable while the continuous variable remained unaltered. The test statistic, the plot containing the true data, is placed randomly among these null plots. If the test statistic is identifiable, the null hypothesis is rejected with a $p$-value of at most 0.05.

%       \label{lineup_dot}
%\end{figure}
%
%We calculated the distance matrices between each of the null plots and the actual plots. Since some of the distance matrices requires both the variables to be continuous , we calculate only the Hamming, the Eucildean, the t-statistic and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test statistic. In this case the hamming distance is calculated by permuting the categorical variable and looking at the number of positions at which the groups are different between the true data and the permuted data. We also calculated the percentile value based on each distance matrices for each of the null plots by finding how many distances smaller than the one obtained for the null plot can we get if we generate 10,000 distances corresponding to the 10,000 permutations of the true data. We repeat the above procedure for all the null plots and all the distances. This tells us how likely it is to observe a particular null plot when you have the true data. %Figure~\ref{emp_eucl} shows the empirical distribution of the Euclidean distances for the true data. 
%We save the different distances for all the null plots ordered according to the smallest percentile value. Table \ref{dot_table} shows the four different distances and the percentile values obtained based on each distance.

%%In order to match the distance measures above to what we actually `see' in a plot, we conducted an experiment asking an audience to judge closeness of null plots to the actual data plot.
%%Each participant was given 5 lineup plots similar to figure~\ref{fig:subfig1}. For each lineup, the participant was asked which of the plots exhibited the strongest positive association between the variables. In a next step, the actual data plot was identified and participants were asked to identify the plots that most closely matched the data plot. 
%%
%%For this study, we had a set of 15 participants evaluating 5 line-ups (of 20 plots) with respect to similarity of nullplots to the actual data chart. The number of `close' charts was not specified -- in the study we true between 1 and 5 responses, with most participants picking 2-3 close charts.

%\section{Example, using scatterplots} \label{sec:asso}
%
%Consider a dataset with two continuous variables $X$ and $Y$. 
%%Let us assume that one variable is the explanatory or independent variable ($X$) and the other variable is the response or dependent variable ($Y$). 
%We are interested in whether there exists a significant positive association between the two variables. To test this we generate a scatterplot of the two variables. If there exists a positive association between the two variables, their values should be close to a line in a scatterplot. \\ \\%the scatterplot shows that the points fall close to the diagonal line in the positive direction. \\ \\
%Assuming independence between the variables, we generate null plots by permuting the response variable i.e. $Y$ while keeping the explanatory variable i.e. $X$ fixed. 
%The test statistic, the plot containing the true data, is placed randomly among 19 null plots as shown in the line up in  Figure~\ref{sca_1}. If the test statistic is identifiable, the null hypothesis is rejected with a $p$-value of at most 0.05.\\

%%       \label{sca_lineup}
%%\end{figure*}
%
%For each of the null plots in the lineup, we compute all of the distances to the true plot.
%The distances between the true plot and 19 null plots are calculated. 
%%Since both the variables are continuous, we can calculate all the distances except the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test which requires grouping in the data which is absent in this case. 
%%\red{there's a lot of overlap between this section and the discussion of the distances. You could shorten things here.}\green{I tried to make this short but I could not do much about this.}
%%The Hamming distance is calculated on the basis of only the permutations of the variable $Y$ and the actual values of the variable are not being used. The $t$-statistic is calculated on the basis of the correlation coefficient between the unchanged $X$ and the permuted $Y$ for each of the 19 null plots. 
%For calculating the binned and the weighted binned distances, we consider a 10 $\times$ 10 grid ($p$ = $q$ = 10) for a total of 100 cells. 
%
%In order to  quantify  these distances, we generate empirical distributions based on 10,000 permutations of $Y$ and estimate corresponding $p$ values as lower tail percentages. 
%%We also calculated the percentile values for each of the null plots for each of the distances. For calculating the percentile values, we generated 10,000 permutations of $Y$ and calculated the different distance measures based on these permutations to obtain the empirical distribution of each of the distance measures.
% Figure~\ref{emp_wbdist} gives  the empirical distribution of the weighted binned distance for our line-up based on a 10 $\times$ 10 grid. \\

%
%%\red{Explain, why this score helps us in the comparison - when is the score high, when is it low?} 
%One way to measure the `difficulty' of spotting the true data plot in the line-up is given by how far away the red line for the true plot is from the blue lines of the null plots. For that, 
%%We are interested in how close a null plot is to the true plot. Moreover we want to compare multiple lineups generated from the same true data. So 
%we calculate a $z$-score value for each of the distance measures by subtracting the mean of the empirical distribution from the distance %measures from the distance measures obtained for each of the 20 plots 
%and dividing it by the (empirical) standard deviation. 
%%of the empirical distribution of the distance measures. 
%So, for the Hamming distances,  the $z$-score for the $k$-th plot in the lineup is obtained as 
%\[
%z_k = \frac{h_k - \mu_H}{\sigma_H}
%\]
%where $h_k$ gives the realized hamming distances for the $k$-th plot in the lineup where $k = 1, \dots, 20$ and $\mu_H$ and $\sigma_H$ gives the mean and the standard deviation of the empirical distribution of the hamming distances, respectively. 
%
%%if $H$ denotes the random variable following the empirical distribution of the hamming distances and , then
%
%
%On the basis of the $z$-scores, we can compare the null plots to the true plot. Here, $\sigma_H$ acts as a ruler which tells us how far each of these 20 plots is from $\mu_H$. Since all of the distance measures are 0 %the hamming , euclidean, binned and weighted bin distance measures are 0 
%for the true plot, the $z$-scores for the true plot for the above measures will simply be $-\mu_H/\sigma_H$. For the 19 null plots, a low $z$-score indicates that the null plot is close to the true plot and a high $z$-score indicates that the null plot is far from the true plot on the basis of the corresponding distance measure. 
%
%Table \ref{sca_table} shows $z$-scores and percentile values of all distance measures for the lineup of Figure~\ref{sca_1}. %}obtained based on the the six different distance measures. 
%For each distance metric, we show all results within a 25\% percentile of the empirical distribution of the distance from the actual data plot, ordered from most similar to least similar. 
%Figure~\ref{sca_2} gives a graphical representation of the table. We can see that most distance measures agree on plot 20 as most similar  to the true data plot, followed by plots 15 and 18.
%
%%We order the 19 null plots based on the lowest $z$-scores and the percentile values. Since the six distance measures have different $z$-scores, we have six different sets of ordered null plots.

%%\section{Comparison of the Distance Measures}
%%
%%For a particular dataset containing two continuous variables $X$ and $Y$, we generate 50 random datasets by permuting the $X$ variable but keeping the $Y$ variable fixed. We compute the distances between the actual data and each of the 50 permuted datasets by using all of the eleven distance measures defined above. We then plot a scatterplot matrix of the eleven distance measures. Figure~\ref{scamat} gives the scatterplot matrix of the eleven distance measures.
%%

%%       \caption{Scatterplot matrix of the distance measures based on the 50 randomly generated datasets obtained by permuting the $X$ variable randomly 50 times.}
%%       \label{scamat}
%%\end{figure}
%%
%%Figure~\ref{scamat} shows that some of the distance measures are highly correlated, positive or negative. The weighted bin distance $w_P(X)$ is highly positively correlated to the weighted canberra distance $wc_P(X)$ and the correlation between $X$ and permuted $X$ ($r_P$) has a high negative correlation to the euclidean distance of the actual values ($d_V$). Also there is a fairly high correlation between t-statistic $t$ and Spearman's rank correlation $\rho$.  So it does not make sense to use all the distance measures as they do not explain the data differently. So we decided to exclude weighted canberra distance, euclidean distance of the actual values and Spearman's rank correlation $\rho$ from the analysis. So we have eight different measures.
%
%%\section{Visual Distance}
%%
%%The main purpose is to find a distance measure from the eight shortlisted distance measures which describes the visual distance in the best possible way. Describing plots numerically with the help of a distance measure is next to impossible. But we want to find the distance measure which works in most situations in most types of data. \\
%%
%%We are interested in datasets with two continuous variables. Let us assume $X$ and $Y$ are the two variables.  We permute one of the continuous variables, say $X$ by keeping the other variable (say $Y$) fixed to obtain one set of permuted data. We repeat the above process 10,000 times to obtain 10,000 randomly generated datasets. \\
%%
%%We calculate the distance between the actual dataset and each of the 10,000 permuted datasets by using the eight shortlisted distance measures from the eleven. Hence we have 10,000 of each of the distance measures. We select those permuted datasets which has the minimum distance from the actual dataset according to the eight distance measures. So we obtain eight permuted datasets which are the closest to the actual dataset. \\
%%
%%The drawbacks with this procedure is that the hamming distance ($h_P$)  and the binned distance ($b_P$) have discrete distributions. Hence, according to these distance measures, in most situations there may be more than one dataset which have the minimum distance from the actual dataset. But we select any one of the datasets randomly. Also in some cases two or more distance measures may yield the same dataset as the one ``closest'' to the actual dataset. In these cases, we randomly select the other datasets from the 10,000 permuted datasets.   \\
%%
%%Then we form a plot-matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns by putting the actual dataset in the middle and randomly placing the other datasets in the other eight positions. Figure~\ref{minimum} shows such a plot-matrix.

%%\section{Datasets}
%%
%%We do not want to restrict ourselves to any particular relationship between the two continuous variables $X$ and $Y$. The distance measure should be able to pick the effect of outliers and clusters in the data. So we come up with four different datasets which generalizes the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ as far as possible. \\

%The experiment is conducted to study the ability of human observers to detect the positive association between two continuous variables. Data is simulated with the sample size $n = 20$ and $n=30$. The continuous variables ($X$,$Y$) are generated from a Bivariate Normal distribution with $\mu_X = 6$, $\mu_Y = 3$, $\sigma_X = 4$, $\sigma_Y = 1$, $\rho_{XY} = \rho$ where $\rho$ is generated from a Uni(0.2, 0.7). Five replicates of the above combination are generated (four with $n =20$ and one with $n=30$). These produced five different ``true data sets". The null plots for the lineups was generated from each of the data sets. \\
%
%Figure~\ref{dist_1} and Figure~\ref{dist_2} gives scatterplots of the People's pick against the z-scores and the percentiles for the distance measures. $R^2$ gives a measure of the correlation between People's pick and the distance measures. The median $R^2$ from the 5 lineups indicates that Spearman's $\rho$ worked best followed by t-statistic and weighted bin.

%\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
%%\green{This section has to be written down}
%The purpose of this paper has been to take a closer look at the null plots that comes up in a lineup along with the true plot. We do that with the help of some distance measures that gives us the measure of closeness of the null plots to the true plot. For this experiment the closeness was measured in case of a scatterplot. Future experiments will be conducted to measure closeness among other types of plots which may use of other distance measures.
%
%%The purpose of this paper has been to examine the effectiveness of visual inference methods in direct comparison to existing inference methods. We need to be clear that this is not the purpose of visual inference generally: visual methods should not be seen as competitors to traditional inference.  The purpose here, is to  establish properties and  efficacy of visual testing procedures in order to use them in situations where traditional tests cannot be used. For this experiment the effect of $\beta_2$ was examined using side-by-side boxplots. Future experiments will be conducted to compare other regression parameters as described in Table \ref{tbl:stat_multiple} and assess sensitivity of power to modeling conditions.

\section*{Appendix}

\subsection*{Selection of the Number of Bins} \label{sec:nbin}

Binned distance works for any type of data and for any null generating mechanism. It does not take into account the graphical elements in the plot, and the raw data is used. Binned distance can be used in situations where no distance measure is known for the particular plot type and hence it can be regarded as universal. But the choice of number of bins or the bin size highly affects the distance. A wrong choice may produce erroneous or conflicting results. Hence the choice of the number of bins is important.

The choice of number of bins or bin sizes is investigated with different types of data. Different null generating mechanisms are also used for the same data type. Null datasets are obtained for a true data using a null generating mechanism and hence a lineup is constructed. Mean binned distance is calculated between the true data and the null datasets and also among the null datasets. The number of bins for the binned distance are varied from 2 to 10 on both $x$ and $y$ direction and $\delta_{\hbox{lineup}}$ is calculated for each combination. Table \ref{tbl:bin1} and Table \ref{tbl:bin2} shows the type of data, the observed plot, the null generating mechanism, a typical null plot, the difference $\delta_{\hbox{lineup}}$ and also the maximum value of $\delta_{\hbox{lineup}}$, the $x$-bin and $y$-bin for which the maximum was obtained. The minimum $\delta_{\hbox{lineup}}$ is also reported to get an idea of the range of values.

The rationale behind selecting different types of data is to investigate how the optimal number of bins or bin sizes varies with different types of data. The different null generating mechanisms are also selected for the same reason. In Table \ref{tbl:bin1} the first four observed data plots corresponds to the datasets described by Francis Anscombe \citep{anscombe:1972} but with large number of data points. Although the datasets have the same pattern, the datasets do not follow the properties of Anscombe's quartet. The fifth dataset is a data with 3 distinct clusters. In Table \ref{tbl:bin2}, the first dataset shows a categorical data. The second and the third data are non-linear and linear association with the presence of outliers. The fourth and fifth datasets are the residual plots with curved pattern and non-constant variance pattern. The sixth data is a spiral data while the seventh one is a data with contamination. 

The differences, $\delta_{\hbox{lineup}}$, are represented in a tile plot where each tile gives the difference for each combination. The dark blue shows higher values while the white shows lower values. It can be seen that the plots look different for the different datasets. Hence the optimal number of bins varies from data to data. No specific pattern is evident in the plot. But overall it can be seen that for strong linear relationship, small number of bins should be preferred over large number of bins. Also when outlier is present in the data, larger number of bins is preferred at least in one axis.

It is important to mention at this point that Table \ref{tbl:bin1} and Table \ref{tbl:bin2} is not meant to provide any guidelines for the selection of number of bins. The Tables only show that the binned distance is highly affected by the number of bins and the type of data. It is advisable to find the optimal number of bins for a given data before using the binned distance.
