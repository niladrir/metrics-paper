Graphics play a crucial role in statistical analysis and data mining. This paper describes developments to assist the use of graphics for making inferential statements. It examines the lineup protocol described in \citet{buja:2009}  
  developing numerical statistics to measure the quality of the lineup. Distance measures are developed that describe how close the true data plot is to the null plots, and how close the null plots are to each other. These measures are compared with choices made by human judges, to decide on the best distance measures to use for particular plot types.

%Statistical graphics play a crucial role in exploratory data analysis, model checking and diagnosis. Until recently there were no formal visual methods in place for determining statistical significance of findings. This changed, when \citep{buja:2009} conceptually introduced two protocols for formal tests of visual findings. In this paper we use the lineup protocol \citep{buja:2009} and take a closer look at the null plots that appear in a lineup along with the true plot. Different distance measures between the null plots and the true plot are calculated. On the basis of these distance measures, a measure of ``closeness'' between the null plots and the true plot is defined. A human subjects experiment is conducted using simulated data to provide controlled conditions. Results suggest that some of the distance measures works better than the others in most situations.

\section{Introduction} 
There have been major advances in statistical graphics over the years, for example, systems like R \citep{R} provide high quality static graphics, and very recently some access to interactive graphics. But the problem remains that graphics are not widely considered to be a part of inferential statistics. Research by \citet{gelman:2004} and \citet{buja:2009} 
potentially changes this. 

The lineup protocol in \citep{buja:2009} 
places a statistical plot firmly in the hypothesis testing framework. The plot of the data is considered to be a test statistic, and this plot is compared with plots from the appropriate null distribution, producing the lineup. Plots from the null distribution can be generated in many ways, depending on the specification of the null. For parametric testing, data can be simulated from a statistical distribution. For non-parametric testing, other data generating mechanisms may be implied. For example in a lineup using scatterplots, where the null hypothesis is no association between the two variables,  a null generating mechanism is to permute one column of numbers. The marginal distributions of the two variables stay the same while any association between the variables is broken. 

The lineup protocol is analogous to the statistical significance calculations in traditional statistical tests. In hypothesis testing, the true value of the test statistic is compared with all possible values of its null distribution. If the statistic is extreme on this scale, there is evidence to disbelieve the null hypothesis. With the lineup protocol, for a data plot to be considered to be extreme, a human judge must pick it as different from the other plots in the lineup.

\end{figure}


In traditional hypothesis testing the sampling distribution of the test statistics is continuous, which allows evaluation of probability on an infinite spectrum. With the lineup, although conceptually we may have an infinite collection of plots from the null distribution, in practice, we sample a finite number of null datasets to generate the lineup. A human judge has a physical limit on the number of null plots they can peruse. This poses one of the issues with using the lineup protocol.  Figure \ref{compare} gives the sampling distribution (black curve) for the $t$-distribution, along with the $t$-statistics of the samples that were drawn from the null distribution (blue bars) and that of the true data (red bar). % for the plots in the lineup shown in Figure \ref{lineup}. 
Effectively,  in visual inference the red line is compared only to these finite number of blue lines visually to make a decision, unlike classical inference where we look at the rejection region (Figure \ref{compare}) to make decisions. As Tukey suggested, `there is such a thing as a bad random sample' \citep{fernholz03}:

\begin{quotation}
There [in Tukey's Data Analysis class] I discovered that [...]  a random sample is indeed a ``batch of values'' which ``fail to be utopian'' most of the time.
\end{quotation}

To avoid basing conclusions on artifacts introduced by a `bad' sample, we need to be aware of properties of this set of null plots. In this paper, we develop techniques that help to determine the quality of the lineup. A variety of distance metrics measuring the ``closeness'' of the true data plot and the null plots, and the null plots with themselves are examined. These are compared to human subject picks in a small experiment.  Describing plots numerically, is something  of an oxymoron, it cannot be done. The purpose is to help determine if a lineup might provide inadequate coverage of the full null distribution, and these measures might help to gain more insight on how the human eyes work in reading statistical graphics. The next section describes the array of distance measures, and further sections describe the scatterplot example, and the process for evaluating the distance measures. 

%Any statistical analysis must include some sreftatistical graphics. For exploratory data analysis, statistical graphics play an invaluable role in model checking and diagnostics. Even though we have established mathematical procedures to obtain various statistics, we need to support the results by also producing the relevant plots. 

%In recent times there have been major advances in statistical graphics. Modern computing systems like R and SAS produce high quality statistical graphics. Buja et al. 2009, following from Gelman 2004, proposed two protocols that allow the testing of discoveries made from statistical graphics.

%In this paper we are interested in the quality of a lineup plot. In visual inference, the actual plot is the test statistic and the lineup plot is the null distribution. Unlike classical inference, the null distribution is represented by the 19 null plots that we obtain randomly from the actual plot assuming that the null hypothesis is true. So the decision of rejection or failure of rejection of the null hypothesis is heavily dependent on these 19 null plots. This induces us to take a closer look at the null plots. For this purpose, we calculate different distance matrices between the null plots and the actual plot to get a measure on how close is each null plot to the actual plot. We also calculate the distance matrices between the null plots to see how close are the null plots to each often. Finally a percentile value is calculated to find how often such a distance appears in a lineup and a z-score of the different distances is calculated to get a measure on the closeness between the null plot and the actual plot and also compare between two different lineups.  

%In this paper we presents results of a human-subject study assessing the performance of the different distance matrices. Section \ref{sec:visual_test} describes the basic idea of the visual inference and also gives the definition of the different distance measures. Section \ref{sec:asso} and Section \ref{user.distance} applies these ideas and uses the definitions to calculate the different distance measures. In Section \ref{results} and Section \ref{sec:conclusions} we outline the setup and present results.

%\section{Visual Statistical Inference and Definitions} \label{sec:visual_test} 

%This section outlines the concepts of visual inference in comparison to the procedures of classical statistical inference and also gives the definition of the different distance measures. 

%Let $\theta$ be a population parameter of interest, with $\theta \in \Theta$, the parameter space. 
%Any null hypothesis $H_0$ then partitions the parameter space into $\Theta_0$ and $\Theta_0^c$, with $H_0: \theta \in \Theta_0$ versus $H_1: \theta \in \Theta_0^c$. 
% In hypothesis testing terminology, the parameter space $\Theta$ of a population parameter $\theta$, can be partitioned into $\Theta_0$ and $\Theta_0^c$. We test $H_0: \theta \in \Theta_0$ versus $H_1: \theta \in \Theta_0^c$.

%\subsection{Visual Statistic} 

%Unlike classical hypothesis testing, the statistic in visual inference is not a single value, but a plot that is appropriately chosen to describe the parameter of interest, $\theta$. When the alternative hypothesis is true, it is expected that the plot of the true data, the test statistic, will have visible feature(s) consistent with $\theta \in \Theta_0^c$, and that visual artifacts will not distinguish the test statistic as different when $H_1$ is not true.

%\begin{dfn}\label{dfn:lplot}
%A lineup plot is a layout of $m$ visual statistics, consisting of 
%\begin{itemize}\itemsep-3pt
%\item $m-1$ plots simulated from the model specified by $H_0$  (null plots) and 
%\item the test statistic produced by plotting the true data, possibly arising from $H_1$.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{dfn}

%If $H_1$ is true, the test statistic is expected to be the plot that is most different from the other plots in the lineup plot. A careful visual inspection should reveal the differences in the feature shown by the test statistic under null and alternative hypothesis. {\em If the test statistic cannot be identified} in the lineup, the conclusion is to {\em not reject the null hypothesis.} The $(m-1)$ null plots can be considered to be samples drawn from the sampling distribution of the test statistic assuming that the null hypothesis is true. \\

%Since the lineup plot consists of $m$ plots, the probability of choosing any one of them is $1/m$. Thus we have a type-I error probability of $1/m$.

%\red{the next three paragraphs might be important, but you loose focus - you want to come as fast as possible to the problematic of the paper, e.g.:}
%The lineup plot can be evaluated by one or more individuals. When a single individual identifies the true graph in the lineup plot we report a $p$-value of at most $1/m$, otherwise the $p$-value is at least $1-\frac 1m$. 
%
%If $N$ individuals evaluate a lineup plot independently, we count the number of successful evaluations as $U \sim \text{Binom} (N,\frac{1}{m})$ and report a  $p$-value of at most $Pr(U \ge u)= \sum_{k \ge u}^N {{N \choose k} (\frac{1}{m})^k(1-\frac 1m)^{(N-k)}}$ where $u$ is the true number of successful evaluations. %Notice that when $N=1$, this $p$-value is $\frac1m$.  \\ 
%
%
%For two different visual test statistics of the same true data, the one  is better, in which a specific pattern is more easily distinguishable visually. \\ \\

%\red{Before distance measures are introduced, introduce the problem of why we look at these distances in the context of permutation tests. }
%The difference between a regular permutation test and a graphical test under the line-up protocol, is that we are comparing the true value of the test statistics (i.e. the plot of the true data) to a finite sample of the sample distribution.

{\color{red} Things to add:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Null-generating mechanisms 
\item Dependence on Question of Interest - in general should not be a problem because the question is ``which is different? ". But for data from Turk study, questions were quite focussed.
\item Interplay between type of plot and distance metric - calculation on data vs graphical elements. For example, scatterplot vs reg line distance
\item Distance metric distribution calculation eg permutation
\item Selection of the number of bins
\end{enumerate}}

\section{Null Generating Mechanism} \label{sec:null}

The null plots play an important role in the evaluation of a lineup as the subjects compare the test statistic to the null plots. The null plots are obtained from the appropriate null distribution which is consistent with the null hypothesis.  Hence, in visual inference, the null generating mechanism is important. The null generating mechanism depends on the hypothesis to be tested and the question of interest. The null distribution can be generated in a few different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Permutation: This is the most common approach. Consider two continuous variables $X$ and $Y$ and assume that we are interested to test whether there is a significant association between the two variables. One approach is to permute the variable $X$ keeping the variable $Y$ to obtain the null data. This approach can also be applied in situations where we have one categorical variable, say, Group and a continuous variable. Let us assume that the variable Group has two levels and we want to test whether there is any difference between the two groups. To generate the null in this case,  the variable Group can be permuted keeping the continuous variable fixed.
\item Simulation under the null model: Simulation from the null model is another approach. The null model is fitted to the true data and then using the parameter estimates, the data is generated. Let us consider that we are interested in testing whether there is any significant linear relationship between two continuous variables $X$ and $Y$. Hence we test for $H_o : \beta_1 = 0$ versus $H_a: \beta_1 \ne 0$. Under the null hypothesis, we fit the following model to the data:
$$Y = \beta_0 + \varepsilon$$
where $\varepsilon \sim \hbox{Normal}(0, \sigma^2)$. The parameter estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\sigma^2$ are obtained and the null data is generated from $\hbox{Normal}(\widehat{\beta_0}, \widehat{\sigma}^2)$. 
\item Simulation from a specific distribution: The null data can also be simulated from a specific distribution depending on the null hypothesis. Suppose we want to test whether data comes from a Normal distribution. Hence the null hypothesis can be thought of as the data comes from a Normal distribution while the alternative hypothesis is that the data does not come from a Normal distribution. Hence the null data are generated from the Normal distribution with mean and standard deviation equal to the estimated mean and standard deviation from the data. 
\end{itemize} 

There may be other null generating mechanism depending on the hypothesis and the question of interest.

\section{Distance measures}

%\blue{The difference between a regular permutation test and a graphical test under the line-up protocol, is that we are comparing the true value of the test statistics (i.e. the plot of the original data) to a finite sample of the sample distribution. As Tukey suggested, `there is such a thing as a bad random sample' \citet{fernholz03}:
%\begin{quotation}
%There [in Tukey's Data Analysis class] I discovered that [...]  a random sample is indeed a ``batch of values" which ``fail to be utopian" most of the time.
%\end{quotation}
%
%To avoid basing our conclusion on artifacts introduced by a `bad' sample, we need to be aware of properties of this set of null plots. In this paper, we are proposing a set of  distance measures that help us in the evaluation of the goodness of a random sample. It also turns out, that these measures give us also some insight in the perceived difficulty of picking the original plot of the data from a particular line-up. 
%
%\subsection*{Distance Measures}
%}

%\red{The distance measures need some more setting up beforehand. I would actually include a small example of a set of scatterplots that highlights the problematic.}
%
%\red{Another thing that we should discuss on Friday is whether it might be better to call the measures we use norms rather than distances - a distance usually assumes the comparison of two objects, and we implicitly compare against null or identity, which is what a norm does..}

There are different types of distance measures suitable in measuring the distance between the null data and the true data. In this paper, six different types of distance measures were used so that they can identify the different characteristics present in a plot. \\

For all of the distance measures below, let $X$ denote the true dataset with one or two variables. Let $Y$ denote the null dataset obtained from $X$ using any of the above mentioned null generating mechanism.

%\blue{For all of the distance measures below, let $P$ be a permutation mapping  the set $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$ onto itself. Let further $[P]$ denote the $n \times n$ matrix associated to permutation $P$.
%}
\begin{itemize}

%\item Hamming Distance: The hamming distance $H$ of $P$ is defined as 
%\[
%H(P) := \sum_{i=1}^n I_{P(i) \neq i},  \text{ where } I_{x} = \left \{ 
%\begin{array}{ll}
%1 & \text{if } x \text{ is true},\\
%0 & \text{otherwise},
%\end{array} \right.
%\]
%i.e. $H(P)$ is a count of the number of fix elements of the function.


%\blue{
%The hamming distance $H$ of $P$ is defined as

%0 & \text{otherwise},
%\end{array} \right.
%\]
%i.e. $H(P)$ is a count of the number of fix elements of the function.
% }

%Hamming distance between two equal length strings is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. 

%This distance matrix measures the distance between the permutation matrix and the identity and does not depend on the actual values of the variables $X$ and $Y$. 


%\blue{let $X$ be a continuous variable. The Euclidean Distance under permutation is then defined as 
%%\red{we need a good short-cut for this distance}
%\[
%d^2_P(X) := || X - [P]X||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - X_{P(i)})^2.
%\]
%}

%\item Euclidean Distance: 
%Let $X$ be a continuous variable. The Euclidean Distance under permutation is then defined as 
%%\red{we need a good short-cut for this distance}
%\[
%d^2_P(X) := || X - [P]X||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - X_{P(i)})^2.
%\]



%Euclidean Distance between two equal length strings measure the distance between the permuted values of one variable and the original continuous variable while the other variable, either continuous or categorical, remains unaltered. This distance matrix takes into  account the actual values of the variable that is permuted and does not depend on the values of the other variable. 

\item Binned Distance:
%\red{write out mathematically, include all definitions - i.e. C(X,Y) needs to be defined - have a look at the grammar of graphics}
Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be two continuous variables. Let $X_1$ be divided into $p$ bins and $X_2$ divided into $q$ bins. $(i,j)$-th cell represents the $j$-th bin of $X_2$ corresponding to the $i$-th bin of $X_1$. Let $C(X_1,X_2)$ be defined as a $p \times q$ matrix. Each $(i,j)$-th element of the matrix represents the number of points falling in the $(i,j)$-th cell, where $i = 1, \dots, p$ , $j = 1, \dots, q$.
The Binned distance is then defined as
\begin{eqnarray*}
d_{\hbox{bin}}^2 (X, Y) &:=& ||C_X(X_1, X_2) - C_Y(X_1,X_2)||^2 \\ &=& \sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^q (C_X(X_{1i},X_{2j}) - C_Y(X_{1i},X_{2j}))^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
Binned distance is highly susceptible to small differences in values and depends on the number of bins as well as exact cut-offs. This is particularly problematic for small number of points. As a remedy to that, we are considering Weighted bin distance next, which is based on the density rather than point frequency. For large number of points the weighted binning is computationally too intensive, in which case we will make use of the unweighted binned distance.
%\red{careful: $C(X,[P]Y)$ is not the same as $C_{i,P(j)}$. $C_{i,j}$ is the count for points falling into cell $i,j$ - it's not enough to permute the grid counts, we need to get the grid counts of the permuted variable. Introduce $C$ as a function of $X$ and $Y$ ....}

% To calculate this distance, we form a $p \times q$ grid between the two continuous variable and count the number of points falling to each grid. Then we permute one continuous variable keeping the other variable unchanged and repeat the above procedure. The euclidean distance between the counts for the original and permuted data gives an measure of the binned distance. Binned distance takes into account both the variables but only one of the variables is permuted. Binned distance considers only the count for each respective bin and puts no weight on the counts of the neighboring bin.

\item Weighted Bin Distance: Using the same setup of the binned distance, the weighted bin distance is defined as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
d_{\hbox{wbin}}^2(X, Y) &:=&||W_X(X_1,X_2) - W_Y(X_1,X_2))||^2 \\ &=& \sum_{i=1}^n (W_X(X_{1i},X_{2i}) - W_Y(X_{1i},X_{2i}))^2 , 
\end{eqnarray*}
where $W(X_{1i},X_{2i})$ denotes the joint (empirical) density of $X_1$, $X_2$ at location $(X_{1i}, X_{2i})$. See Figure \ref{fig:test_category} for a comparison of weighted and unweighted binned distance at the example of 20  points.
%The weighted bin distance is an improvement to the bin distance where a weight is provided to the counts of the neighboring bins. The weight is done by doing a kernel density estimation of the different bins.

%\green{I wrote something down here but I am not sure if this works.}

       \label{fig:test_category}
\end{figure}


\item Hausdorff distance: Let $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$ be two sets of points. The Hausdorff distance between $X$ and $Y$ is defined as
 \[
d_{\hbox{hausdorff}}(X, Y)  = max (h(X, Y), h(Y, X))
\]
where 
\begin{eqnarray*}
h(X, Y) &:=& \max_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} ||x - y|| \\ & = & \max_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}
\end{eqnarray*}

This measure is computationally intensive.

\end{itemize}

%The remaining distance measures are different from the ones above, in that they are used to directly draw inference on a linear association between variables $X$ and $Y$, whereas the other ones were not specifically tailored to this purpose.

%\blue{The remaining distance measures are different from the ones above, in that they are used to directly draw inference on a linear association between variables $X$ and $Y$, whereas the other ones were not specifically tailored to this purpose.}
The remaining distance measures are different from the ones above, in that they are used for specific plot types and cannot be used for any type of data. The following distance measures uses the graphical element to calculate the distances.

\begin{itemize}
\item Distance for univariate data: Let $X$ be a continuous variable. Then the distance metric is given by
\[
d^2_{\hbox{uni}}(X, Y) := ||m(X) - m(Y)||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^4 ((m(X))_i - (m(Y))_i)^2
\]
where $m(.)$ is a vector of the mean, the standard deviation, the skewness and the kurtosis of the variable. This distance metric works for univariate distributions using only the graphical elements in the plot.


\item Distance based on boxplots : Let $X_1$ be a categorical variable representing the groups in the data and $X_2$ be a continuous variable. Then the distance metric is given by
 \[
d^2_{\hbox{box}}(X, Y) := || d_q(X) - d_q(Y)||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^3 ((d_q(X))_i - (d_q(Y))_i)^2
\]

where $d_q(.)$ is a vector giving the absolute difference of the first quartile, median and the third quartile of $X_2$ between the two groups in $X_1$. This distance measure works specifically for the boxplots using only the graphical elements. This is based on the assumption that after the boxplots have already been constructed, the subjects only look at the difference in the boxes to make the distinction. 


\item Distance based on the regression line: Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be two continuous variables. $X_1$ and $X_2$ are plotted in a scatterplot and assume that the scatterplot is binned vertically into $b$ bins. In each vertical bin, a linear regression model is fitted and the regression coefficients i.e. the estimated intercept and the estimeted slope are noted. The distance metric based on the regression coefficients is given by
 \[
d^2_{\hbox{reg}}(X, Y) := \hbox{tr} (B(X) - B(Y))' (B(X) - B(Y)) = \sum_{i=1}^b ((b_0(X))_i - (b_0(Y))_i)^2 + \sum_{i=1}^b ((b_1(X))_i - (b_1(Y))_i)^2
\]

where $b_0$ and $b_1$ denote the vector of the intercept and slope respectively while $b$ is the number of bins. $B(.)$ is a $b \times 2$ matrix of the regression coefficients where each row represent the  intercept and the slope obtained from each bin. The number of bins have a significant effect on the distance measure. It can be seen that it works best for smaller number of bins like 1 or 2. With larger number of bins (i.e. smaller bin sizes), the regression coefficients are affected by the skewness of the data.

\end{itemize}

The last two distance measures are also dependent on the question of interest and hence can be changed accordingly. But in general this should not be a problem because the question is ``Which plot among these is different ?". 
%\item $t$ statistic: In this paper we used the test statistic of a t-test based on the correlation coefficient $r$ where $$t =\frac{r \sqrt{n - 2}}{\sqrt{1 - r^2}}$$ where $n$ is the number of observations in $X$ or $Y$. This is the only measure that makes a distributional assumption that the ($X$,$Y$) follows approximately a bivariate Normal distribution. Hence the $t$-statistic follows a t distribution with ($n$ - 2) degrees of freedom.
%%\red{use either upper case or lower case $T$, not both. }
%%The first one was used when one variable is continuous and the other is categorical while the other is used when both the variables are continuous.  
%
%%\item Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test statistic: This is a nonparametric test statistic for assessing whether one of the two samples of independent observations tend to have larger values than the other. This is also used when one variable is continuous and the other is categorical.  
%
%\item Spearman's rank correlation $\rho$ : $\rho$ is a nonparametric alternative to the correlation coefficient with Kendall's $\tau$. $X$ and $Y$ are converted into the ranks $x$ and $y$. Assuming there are no ties in the data, the differences $d_i=x_i - y_i$ between the ranks of each observation between the two variables are calculated and $\rho$ is given as $$\rho = 1 - \frac{6\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$ The Spearman's rank correlation is a better measure of correlation than the Pearson's rank correlation if the data contains some outliers. Kendall's $\tau$ is computationally intensive
%% - the naive implementation is $O(n^2)$, but it can be reduced to $O(n \log n)$, which is equivalent to sorting.}
%%takes huge time \red{could you be more specific - is it $O(n^2)$? - I think it can be brought down to $O(n \log n)$} \green{I think I used 2 for loops. So it should be $O(n^2)$. But I am not sure if it can be brought down to $O(n \log n)$}to calculate for an averaged size sample. 
%So in this paper we considered $\rho$ as the only nonparametric measure.
%%\red{which one of the statistics do you refer to?} 
%%\red{give a mathematical definition of $\rho$}
%$\rho$ uses both the variables. 
%
%
%\item Euclidean Distance of permutations: The Euclidean distance of permutations $P$ is 
%\[
%d^2_P(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n ( i - P(i))^2.
%\]
%where $i = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$
%
%
%\item Canberra Distance: Using exactly the same setup as the binned distance , the canberra distance under permutation is defined as
%%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\[
%c^2_P(X)  = \left \{ 
%\begin{array}{ll}
%\sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^q \frac{ |C_{X_i,Y_j} - C_{X_i,P(Y)_j}|}{ C_{X_i,Y_j} + C_{X_i,P(Y)_j}} & \text{if } C_{X_i,Y_j} + C_{X_i,P(Y)_j} > 0,\\

%Like the binned distance, the canberra distance is also effected by the number of bins used. Here again we use the usual convention as the binned distance. Canberra distance is an improvement to the binned distance as it puts less weight on the bins which has a large number of points than the bins with fewer points. Visually it is difficult to differentiate between a single point and a number of points having the exact coordinates. Canberra distance has the same drawbacks as the binned distance. So we defined the weighted canberra distance which is a similar measure as the weighted bin distance.
%
%\item Weighted Canberra Distance:  Using the same setup of the weighted bin distance, the weighted canberra distance under permutation is defined as 
%%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\[
%wc_P^2(X) = \left \{ 
%\begin{array}{ll}
%\sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^q \frac{ |W_{X_i,Y_j} - W_{X_i,P(Y)_j}|}{ W_{X_i,Y_j} + W_{X_i,P(Y)_j}} & \text{if } W_{X_i,Y_j} + W_{X_i,P(Y)_j} > 0,\\
%0 & \text{otherwise},
%\end{array} \right.
%\] 
%%\end{eqnarray*}
%where like the weighted bin distance, $W_{X_i,Y_i}$ denotes the joint (empirical) density of $X$, $Y$ at location $(X_i, Y_i)$. 
%
%\item Correlation between $Y$ and $[P]Y$: Let $Y$ be a continuous variable.The correlation between the $Y$ and $[P]Y$ is defined as
%\[
%r_P(X) = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y_i})(Y_{P(i)} - \bar{Y}_{P(i)})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \bar{Y_i})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_{P(i)}- \bar{Y}_{P(i)})^2}}.

\section{Distance metric distribution} \label{sec:dist}

To calculate the distance between the true plot and the null plots in a lineup, the distance between each of the $m = 20$ plots in the lineup is calculated. Then the mean distance for the true plot is calculated by taking the mean of the distance of the true plot from the $(m - 1)$ null plots. The mean distances for the null plots are calculated by taking the mean distance of the other $(m - 2)$ null plots. If the mean distance for the true plot is larger than all the mean distances for the null plots, the lineup may be regarded as an ``easy" lineup. Otherwise it would be considered a ``difficult" lineup.


The empirical distributions of the distance metrics can be obtained using the null generating mechanism. To generate the empirical distribution of the distance, $N$ null datasets are simulated using the null generating mechanism where $N$ is a large number of the order $10^3$ or $10^4$. Now assuming each of these null datasets as the ``true" data set, $m - 2$ null datasets are obtained using the same mechanism. The distance between the ``true" null dataset and the null datasets obtained is calculated and the mean distance is noted. Repeating the above procedure for $N$ null datasets, $N$ mean distances are obtained which provides the empirical distribution of the distance.

The empirical distribution of the distance based on regression is shown in Figure \ref{dist}. To generate this distribution, $N = 1000$ and $m = 20$ was used.

Figure \ref{dist_1} shows the lineup plot for $m = 20$ for testing whether there exists a significant linear relationship between $X_1$ and $X_2$. The 19 null plots are generated by simulation under the null model. The distance based on the regression parameters is used here as the regression line is overlaid on the scatterplot. Figure \ref{dist_2} shows the empirical distribution of the distance with the distance for the true plot (in orange) and the null plots (in black). The distance for the true plot is calculated by taking the mean of all the distances between the true plot (Plot 9) and the null plots. The distances for the null plots are obtained by taking the mean of the distances between the null plot and the other null plots. The distribution was obtained by using the above mentioned method. The true plot is easy to be identified in the lineup (Figure \ref{dist_1}). It can also be seen in Figure \ref{dist_2} as the orange line is extreme compared to the black lines.

Figure \ref{dist2_1} shows the lineup plot for $m = 20$ for testing whether there exists a significant difference between the two groups. The 19 null plots are generated by permuting the group variable keeping the other variable fixed. The distance based on boxplots  is used here as the plot type is boxplot. Figure \ref{dist2_2} shows the empirical distribution of the distance with the distance for the true plot (in orange) and the null plots (in black). The distances between the plots in the lineup and the distribution are calculated in the same procedure as described above. It can be seen that the true plot is hard to be identified from the lineup which is also evident from the distribution as the orange line is less than most of the black lines.

\section{Effect of Plot type and Question of interest }

Previous studies have suggested that the type of plot used in the lineup have an effect on the response of the subjects \citep{zhao:2012}. For example the subjects find it easier to identify the true plot for a large sample data when a box plot is used in the lineup instead of a dot plot. Similarly the distance metric should also be altered according to the plot type. The distance metric should account for the additional information provided by the graphical elements in the lineup. The graphical elements, like the presence of a box or a regression line overlaid on a scatterplot may influence the response of the subject. Figure \ref{plottype} illustrates this idea. 

\begin{figure*}[hbtp]

\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{type_1} shows a lineup of scatterplots with 100 points between two variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. Figure \ref{type_2}, on the other hand, gives a lineup of the same scatterplots with the regression line overlaid. Showing Figure \ref{type_1}, if the subjects are asked to identify the plot which has the steepest slope, then the subjects probably will face some difficulty in identifying the true plot. But in Figure \ref{type_2}, the regression line overlaid makes it easier for the subjects to identify the true plot. A different distance metric should be used in each case to correctly measure the quality of the lineup.

The question asked to the subjects plays an important role to identify the true plot in the lineup. A minor change in the question can change the response of the subject. In Figure \ref{dist2_1}, if the subjects are asked to identify the plot in which the green group has a larger vertical difference than the red group, the subjects should pick Plot 6. If the subjects are asked which plot has the largest vertical difference between the two groups, the subjects should pick Plot 15. A distance metric should also take into account the question of interest. But, in general, the question of interest is which plot among these is different.

\section{Selection of the number of bins}

The number of bins or the bin width plays an important role in the calculation of the binned distance. Binned distance with a wrong choice of bins may produce erroneous results and hence may change the interpretation of lineup. The correct choice may depend on a number of factors like the type of observed data, the null generating mechanism and others. To investigate this problem, different datasets with two variables with different characteristics were generated. A lineup is constructed by using one of the null generating mechanisms described in Section \ref{sec:null}. A different combination of the number of bins ranging from 2 to 15 was used to divide each variable in the dataset. The number of points falling in each cell is noted. The binned distance is calculated between each of the plots in the lineup. The mean distance between the observed plot and the null plots and the null plots between each other were calculated as described in Section \ref{sec:dist}. The difference between the mean distance for the observed plot and the maximum of the mean distance for the null plots is calculated for each lineup for the different combinations of the number of bins. Table \ref{tbl:bin1} and Table \ref{tbl:bin2} shows the type of data, the observed plot, the null generating mechanism, a typical null plot, the difference and the preferable number of bins.

The first four observed data plots in Table \ref{tbl:bin1} corresponds to the datasets described by Francis Anscombe in \citep{anscombe:1972} with large number of data points. The other six observed datasets are generated to cover the different issues in statistical analysis. Three different null generating mechanisms have been used as defined in Section \ref{sec:null}. Among the 19 null plots, one null plot has been reported to show how different the null plots are from the observed plot. The plots in the fifth column provides the difference as defined in Section \ref{sec:results} for different number of bins on both $x$ and $y$ direction. The observed plot would be easier to identify if the difference is large. The blue in the plot shows larger difference while the white shows smaller difference. It can be observed that to obtain larger difference, different number of bins is required for different types of dataset and different null generating mechanism. Linear association in the observed dataset when permutation was used for generating the null plots requires smaller number of bins to obtain the largest difference while in case of the presence of outliers, larger number of bins is required to detect. 


\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

{\color{blue} Description of the Turk Results and analysis.}

The performance of the distance metrics was evaluated with comparing the distances with the response of the subjects. A number of experiments were done in Amazon Mechanical Turk \citep{turk}. Subjects were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk \citep{turk} and were shown a sequence of lineups. In each experiment, they were asked specific questions. Their response was recorded along with other information. The details about the design of experiments can be found in \cite{majumder:2011} and \cite{roychowdhury:2013}. 

In each experiment, the distance between the plots in these lineups were calculated using some distance measures defined above. The method discussed in Section \ref{sec:dist} was used to compute the mean distance of the true plot from the null plots and the mean distances of the null plots. Two different statistics were calculated using the mean distances:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Difference: the difference between the mean distance for the true plot and the maximum of the mean distances for the null plots. Mathematically,
$$\hbox{diff} = \bar{d}_{\hbox{true}} - \max_j \bar{d}_{\hbox{null}_j}$$
for $j = 1, \dots, (m  - 1).$
 A positive difference would indicate that the mean distance of the true plot is greater than the maximum of the mean distances of the null plots. Hence the true plot is extreme compared to all the null plots. Similarly a negative difference indicates that there is at least one null plot which is extreme compared to the true plot based on the distance.
\item Larger than the true plot: the number of null plots which have larger mean distances than the mean distance of the true plot is noted. Mathematically,
$$\hbox{larger} = \sum_{j = 1}^{m - 1} a_j$$ where 
\begin{equation}
a_j =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \bar{d}_{\hbox{null}_j} > \bar{d}_{\hbox{true}} ,
\\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
A large value of this measure would indicate that there are a number of null plots more extreme than the true plot and hence it is hard to identify the true plot in the lineup.
\end{enumerate}

 
\subsection{Turk Experiment -- Side by Side Boxplots}

In this experiment, the test statistic is a side by side boxplot. Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, the null plots are generated by assuming that there is no difference between the two distributions. The subjects were shown a few lineups and were asked to identify the plot which has the largest vertical difference between group 1 and group 2. Figure \ref{turk1} gives such a lineup. \\

\end{figure}

The response of the subjects were noted and the proportion of correct response was calculated for each lineup. The distances between the plots for each lineup in this experiment were computed using both the distance based on boxplots ($d_{\hbox{box}}$) and the binned distance ($d_{\hbox{bin}}$). Using the calculated distances, the mean distance of the true plot from the null plots and the mean distance of each of the null plots from the others were calculated. Finally both the statistics described above were calculated. The proportion of correct response was plotted against each of the two statistics. Figure \ref{t1comp_1} - (b) shows the results for $d_{\hbox{box}}$.

In Figure \ref{t1comp_1}, the proportion correct is plotted against the difference. The red vertical line represents difference equal to 0 indicating that the mean distance of the observed plot is equal to the maximum of the mean distance of the null plots i.e. the mean distance of the observed plot is equal to at least one of the mean distance of the null plots. It can be seen that as the difference increases, the proportion correct increases. So the subjects do better in the easier lineups than the hard ones. Figure \ref{t1comp_2} shows the relation between larger and the proportion correct. It can be seen that as there are more extreme null plots compared to the observed plot, the subjects find it difficult to pick the observed plot. It is interesting to see that the subjects can pick the observed plot with one or two extreme null plots. 

The results using $d_{\hbox{bin}}$ with 8 bins on each axis are shown in Figure \ref{t1bin_1} - (b). As before, the proportion correct is plotted against difference in Figure \ref{t1bin_1} and against larger in Figure \ref{t1bin_2}. The binned distance does a decent job in this case. The proportion correct increases as the difference increases. But according to the binned distance, there are a few lineups which has a negative difference but the proportion correct is above 60\%. It should be noted that the binned distance does not take into account the graphical elements of the plot (e.g. boxplot) and calculates the distance solely based on the data. So an outlier may have a huge effect on the binned distance but does not effect the distance based on the boxplots. Hence it is advisable to use a distance based on the graphical elements since that is exactly what the subjects look at in the lineup.

\subsection{Turk Experiment -- Scatterplots with a regression line overlaid}

In this experiment, the test statistic is a scatterplot with the regression line overlaid. Assuming that the null hypothesis is true, the null plots are generated by assuming that there is no significant linear relationship between the two variables. The subjects were shown a few lineups and were asked to identify the plot which has the steepest slope. Figure \ref{turk2} gives such a lineup.

\label{turk2}
\end{figure}

The distances between the plots in this experiment were computed using both the distance based on regression line ($d_{\hbox{reg}}$) and the binned distance ($d_{\hbox{bin}}$) with a small number of bins. As before, the proportion of correct response for each lineup was calculated from the response of the subjects. The mean distances for the observed plot and the null plots are calculated as described in Section \ref{sec:dist}. The two statistics described above were calculated based on these mean distances and plotted against the proportion correct. Figure \ref{t2comp_1} - (b) shows the results for the distance based on the regression line.

Figure \ref{t2comp_1} shows the proportion correct against the difference. The vertical line represents difference equal to 0. It can be seen that as the difference increases, the proportion correct increases. So the subjects do better in the easier lineups than the hard ones. Figure \ref{t2comp_2} shows that as there are more extreme null plots compared to the observed plot, the subjects find it difficult to pick the observed plot. For a few lineups, almost all the subjects identify the observed plot although there is one more extreme null plot. Though from Figure \ref{t2comp_1}, it can be seen that the extremeness is marginal in most cases. The binned distance fails to perform in this case since the binned distance does not take into account the graphical element of the plot which is the regression line. The regression line seem to have an huge effect in the correct evaluation of these lineups.

\subsection{Turk Experiment -- Large $p$, Small $n$ data}

In this experiment, the one dimensional or two dimensional projections are plotted. The data has two or three groups with 30 observations($n$) with large number of dimensions($p$). All the plots in the lineup has 2 or 3 clusters in different colors and the subjects were asked to identify the plot with the most separated colored groups. Figure \ref{largep} gives an example of such a lineup with 3 groups.

\section{Conclusion}
 
%\section{People's pick method}\label{user.distance}
%
%To explore how well the various distance measures matched visual characteristics of the lineup,  we conducted a human subject's experiment. For the scatterplot example, each participant was given 5 lineups similar to that in Figure \ref{sca_1}. The participant was asked (1) which of the plots exhibited the strongest positive association between the variables, and then after revealing the location of the true data plot,  (2) the participants were asked to identify the plots that looked the most similar to the true data plot. There were 15 participants.  It is the second evaluation, on the closeness of the null plots to true data plot, that we focused on. Most people provided 2-3 closeness picks.  Because we didn't specifically request participants to order their closeness picks, we combined the picks, putting more emphasis if the plot was listed as the first or second, than if they were of the second or third choices:

%Based on these ranks we define percentages for the {\it people's pick} as follows:

%\red{Describe how the data looks like. Then describe how we can use the data to get a user defined 'closeness' or distance.} \green{I am not sure what to write here.}

%\green{For each lineup and each participant, we recorded their choice of the true plot and the "close" plots to the true. On the basis of their responses, we calculated the proportion of first 4 choices of the participants as follows:

% as the number of participants who chose the plot which appeared most in their first choices over the number of participants who responded. The proportion of second choice of the participants was defined as the number of participants which appeared the second most time over the number of people who responded their first two choices but did not choose the plot of the first choice. 

%We define
%\[
%\hbox{People's pick} = \frac{2}{3} p_{1,2} + \frac{1}{3} p_{2,3}
%\]
%where $p_{1,2}$ is the proportion of participants listing the plot  in the first or second place in the list and $p_{2,3}$ is the proportion of participants listing the plot in the second or third place.
%
%%Let the proportion of the first choice of the participants be defined as
%%\[
%%p_1 = \frac{m_1}{n_1}
%%\]
%%where $m_1$ is the number of participants who chose the plot which appeared the most frequent times in the first choice and $n_1$ is the number of participants who responded in the first choice.
%%For $i = 2, \dots, 4$, the proportion $p_i$ of the $i$-th choice of the participant  is defined as
%%\[
%%p_i = \frac{m_i}{n_i}
%%\]
%%where $m_i$ is the number of participants who chose the plot which appeared the most frequent times in the first $i$ choices but not the plot which matches the $(i-1)$-th choice and $n_i$ is the number of participants who reported at least  $i$ choices. Table \ref{sca_table} gives the People's pick for the lineup in Figure~\ref{sca_1}.

%\section{Example, using dotplots} \label{sec:diff}
%
%Consider a dataset with one variable which is essentially continuous. This variable is divided into two groups. Let us call these two groups as Group A and Group B. We can look this dataset as a dataset consisting of two variables, one of which is a continuous variable and the other is a categorical variable with two levels. Now we want to know whether the values of the continuous variable in Group B are generally higher than the values of the continuous variable in Group A. To test this we generate a dot-plot with the two groups represented with two different colors. If the values of the continuous variable for Group B are higher than that for Group A, the dot-plot shows a vertical displacement between the two colored groups. \\
%A lineup including this test statistic is shown in Figure \ref{lineup_dot}. The 19 null plots are generated by permuting the categorical variable while the continuous variable remained unaltered. The test statistic, the plot containing the true data, is placed randomly among these null plots. If the test statistic is identifiable, the null hypothesis is rejected with a $p$-value of at most 0.05.

%       \label{lineup_dot}
%\end{figure}
%
%We calculated the distance matrices between each of the null plots and the actual plots. Since some of the distance matrices requires both the variables to be continuous , we calculate only the Hamming, the Eucildean, the t-statistic and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test statistic. In this case the hamming distance is calculated by permuting the categorical variable and looking at the number of positions at which the groups are different between the true data and the permuted data. We also calculated the percentile value based on each distance matrices for each of the null plots by finding how many distances smaller than the one obtained for the null plot can we get if we generate 10,000 distances corresponding to the 10,000 permutations of the true data. We repeat the above procedure for all the null plots and all the distances. This tells us how likely it is to observe a particular null plot when you have the true data. %Figure \ref{emp_eucl} shows the empirical distribution of the Euclidean distances for the true data. 
%We save the different distances for all the null plots ordered according to the smallest percentile value. Table \ref{dot_table} shows the four different distances and the percentile values obtained based on each distance.

%%In order to match the distance measures above to what we actually `see' in a plot, we conducted an experiment asking an audience to judge closeness of null plots to the actual data plot.
%%Each participant was given 5 lineup plots similar to figure \ref{fig:subfig1}.

%%For this study, we had a set of 15 participants evaluating 5 line-ups (of 20 plots) with respect to similarity of nullplots to the actual data chart. The number of `close' charts was not specified -- in the study we true between 1 and 5 responses, with most participants picking 2-3 close charts.

%\section{Example, using scatterplots} \label{sec:asso}
%
%Consider a dataset with two continuous variables $X$ and $Y$. 
%%Let us assume that one variable is the explanatory or independent variable ($X$) and the other variable is the response or dependent variable ($Y$). 
%We are interested in whether there exists a significant positive association between the two variables. To test this we generate a scatterplot of the two variables. If there exists a positive association between the two variables, their values should be close to a line in a scatterplot. \\ \\%the scatterplot shows that the points fall close to the diagonal line in the positive direction. \\ \\
%Assuming independence between the variables, we generate null plots by permuting the response variable i.e. $Y$ while keeping the explanatory variable i.e. $X$ fixed. 
%The test statistic, the plot containing the true data, is placed randomly among 19 null plots as shown in the line up in  Figure \ref{sca_1}. If the test statistic is identifiable, the null hypothesis is rejected with a $p$-value of at most 0.05.\\

%%\end{figure*}
%
%For each of the null plots in the lineup, we compute all of the distances to the true plot.
%The distances between the true plot and 19 null plots are calculated. 
%%Since both the variables are continuous, we can calculate all the distances except the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test which requires grouping in the data which is absent in this case. 
%%\red{there's a lot of overlap between this section and the discussion of the distances. You could shorten things here.}\green{I tried to make this short but I could not do much about this.}
%%The Hamming distance is calculated on the basis of only the permutations of the variable $Y$ and the actual values of the variable are not being used. The $t$-statistic is calculated on the basis of the correlation coefficient between the unchanged $X$ and the permuted $Y$ for each of the 19 null plots. 
%For calculating the binned and the weighted binned distances, we consider a 10 $\times$ 10 grid ($p$ = $q$ = 10) for a total of 100 cells. 
%
%In order to  quantify  these distances, we generate empirical distributions based on 10,000 permutations of $Y$ and estimate corresponding $p$ values as lower tail percentages. 
%%We also calculated the percentile values for each of the null plots for each of the distances. For calculating the percentile values, we generated 10,000 permutations of $Y$ and calculated the different distance measures based on these permutations to obtain the empirical distribution of each of the distance measures.

%%\red{Explain, why this score helps us in the comparison - when is the score high, when is it low?} 
%One way to measure the `difficulty' of spotting the true data plot in the line-up is given by how far away the red line for the true plot is from the blue lines of the null plots. For that, 
%%We are interested in how close a null plot is to the true plot. Moreover we want to compare multiple lineups generated from the same true data. So 
%we calculate a $z$-score value for each of the distance measures by subtracting the mean of the empirical distribution from the distance %measures from the distance measures obtained for each of the 20 plots 
%and dividing it by the (empirical) standard deviation. 
%%of the empirical distribution of the distance measures. 
%So, for the Hamming distances,  the $z$-score for the $k$-th plot in the lineup is obtained as 
%\[
%z_k = \frac{h_k - \mu_H}{\sigma_H}
%\]
%where $h_k$ gives the realized hamming distances for the $k$-th plot in the lineup where $k = 1, \dots, 20$ and $\mu_H$ and $\sigma_H$ gives the mean and the standard deviation of the empirical distribution of the hamming distances, respectively. 
%
%%if $H$ denotes the random variable following the empirical distribution of the hamming distances and , then
%
%
%On the basis of the $z$-scores, we can compare the null plots to the true plot. Here, $\sigma_H$ acts as a ruler which tells us how far each of these 20 plots is from $\mu_H$. Since all of the distance measures are 0 %the hamming , euclidean, binned and weighted bin distance measures are 0 
%for the true plot, the $z$-scores for the true plot for the above measures will simply be $-\mu_H/\sigma_H$. For the 19 null plots, a low $z$-score indicates that the null plot is close to the true plot and a high $z$-score indicates that the null plot is far from the true plot on the basis of the corresponding distance measure. 
%
%Table \ref{sca_table} shows $z$-scores and percentile values of all distance measures for the lineup of Figure~\ref{sca_1}. %}obtained based on the the six different distance measures. 
%For each distance metric, we show all results within a 25\% percentile of the empirical distribution of the distance from the actual data plot, ordered from most similar to least similar. 
%Figure~\ref{sca_2} gives a graphical representation of the table. We can see that most distance measures agree on plot 20 as most similar  to the true data plot, followed by plots 15 and 18.
%
%%We order the 19 null plots based on the lowest $z$-scores and the percentile values. Since the six distance measures have different $z$-scores, we have six different sets of ordered null plots. Table \ref{sca_table} shows only the plots whose distance measure is less than the first quartile of the distances obtained for the null plots.

%%\section{Comparison of the Distance Measures}
%%
%%For a particular dataset containing two continuous variables $X$ and $Y$, we generate 50 random datasets by permuting the $X$ variable but keeping the $Y$ variable fixed. We compute the distances between the actual data and each of the 50 permuted datasets by using all of the eleven distance measures defined above. We then plot a scatterplot matrix of the eleven distance measures. Figure \ref{scamat} gives the scatterplot matrix of the eleven distance measures.
%%

%%       \caption{Scatterplot matrix of the distance measures based on the 50 randomly generated datasets obtained by permuting the $X$ variable randomly 50 times.}
%%       \label{scamat}
%%\end{figure}
%%
%%Figure \ref{scamat} shows that some of the distance measures are highly correlated, positive or negative. The weighted bin distance $w_P(X)$ is highly positively correlated to the weighted canberra distance $wc_P(X)$ and the correlation between $X$ and permuted $X$ ($r_P$) has a high negative correlation to the euclidean distance of the actual values ($d_V$). Also there is a fairly high correlation between t-statistic $t$ and Spearman's rank correlation $\rho$.  So it does not make sense to use all the distance measures as they do not explain the data differently. So we decided to exclude weighted canberra distance, euclidean distance of the actual values and Spearman's rank correlation $\rho$ from the analysis. So we have eight different measures.
%
%%\section{Visual Distance}
%%
%%The main purpose is to find a distance measure from the eight shortlisted distance measures which describes the visual distance in the best possible way. Describing plots numerically with the help of a distance measure is next to impossible. But we want to find the distance measure which works in most situations in most types of data. \\
%%
%%We are interested in datasets with two continuous variables. Let us assume $X$ and $Y$ are the two variables.  We permute one of the continuous variables, say $X$ by keeping the other variable (say $Y$) fixed to obtain one set of permuted data. We repeat the above process 10,000 times to obtain 10,000 randomly generated datasets. \\
%%
%%We calculate the distance between the actual dataset and each of the 10,000 permuted datasets by using the eight shortlisted distance measures from the eleven. Hence we have 10,000 of each of the distance measures. We select those permuted datasets which has the minimum distance from the actual dataset according to the eight distance measures. So we obtain eight permuted datasets which are the closest to the actual dataset. \\
%%
%%The drawbacks with this procedure is that the hamming distance ($h_P$)  and the binned distance ($b_P$) have discrete distributions. Hence, according to these distance measures, in most situations there may be more than one dataset which have the minimum distance from the actual dataset. But we select any one of the datasets randomly. Also in some cases two or more distance measures may yield the same dataset as the one ``closest'' to the actual dataset. In these cases, we randomly select the other datasets from the 10,000 permuted datasets.   \\
%%
%%Then we form a plot-matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns by putting the actual dataset in the middle and randomly placing the other datasets in the other eight positions. Figure \ref{minimum} shows such a plot-matrix.

%%\section{Datasets}
%%
%%We do not want to restrict ourselves to any particular relationship between the two continuous variables $X$ and $Y$. The distance measure should be able to pick the effect of outliers and clusters in the data. So we come up with four different datasets which generalizes the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ as far as possible. \\

%The experiment is conducted to study the ability of human observers to detect the positive association between two continuous variables. Data is simulated with the sample size $n = 20$ and $n=30$. The continuous variables ($X$,$Y$) are generated from a Bivariate Normal distribution with $\mu_X = 6$, $\mu_Y = 3$, $\sigma_X = 4$, $\sigma_Y = 1$, $\rho_{XY} = \rho$ where $\rho$ is generated from a Uni(0.2, 0.7). Five replicates of the above combination are generated (four with $n =20$ and one with $n=30$). These produced five different ``true data sets". The null plots for the lineups was generated from each of the data sets. \\
%
%Figure \ref{dist_1} and Figure \ref{dist_2} gives scatterplots of the People's pick against the z-scores and the percentiles for the distance measures. $R^2$ gives a measure of the correlation between People's pick and the distance measures. The median $R^2$ from the 5 lineups indicates that Spearman's $\rho$ worked best followed by t-statistic and weighted bin.

%\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
%%\green{This section has to be written down}
%The purpose of this paper has been to take a closer look at the null plots that comes up in a lineup along with the true plot. We do that with the help of some distance measures that gives us the measure of closeness of the null plots to the true plot. For this experiment the closeness was measured in case of a scatterplot. Future experiments will be conducted to measure closeness among other types of plots which may use of other distance measures.
%
%%The purpose of this paper has been to examine the effectiveness of visual inference methods in direct comparison to existing inference methods. We need to be clear that this is not the purpose of visual inference generally: visual methods should not be seen as competitors to traditional inference.  The purpose here, is to  establish properties and  efficacy of visual testing procedures in order to use them in situations where traditional tests cannot be used. For this experiment the effect of $\beta_2$ was examined using side-by-side boxplots. Future experiments will be conducted to compare other regression parameters as described in Table \ref{tbl:stat_multiple} and assess sensitivity of power to modeling conditions.
